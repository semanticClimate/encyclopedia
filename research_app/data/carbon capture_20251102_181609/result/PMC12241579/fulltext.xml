Among ECCs, electrochemically mediated amine regeneration (EMAR) reached higher technology readiness levels, moving from small-scale laboratory studies toward pilot-scale implementations. Previous EMAR systems rely on ion-selective membranes, which contribute significantly to the cost and present challenges for long-term operation. This study presents a membraneless EMAR system by fundamentally redesigning the process configuration and using gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) as both the anode and cathode. This setup eliminates the membrane and the need for additional equipment such as the absorption column, flash tank, and pumps, significantly reducing the process footprint and simplifying the flow diagram. Two GDE configurations, mesh-attached and electrodeposited, are tested and compared in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> removal efficiency, current density, and energy consumption. Electrodeposited GDEs achieve CO<sub>2</sub> removal efficiencies above 90% with energy consumption as low as 60&#x02009;kJ/mol CO<sub>2</sub>. A techno-economic analysis estimates a levelized cost of capture of ~$70/tonneCO<sub>2</sub>, compared to $137/tonneCO<sub>2</sub> for conventional EMAR. Further improvements in current density and removal efficiency may enable costs below $50/tonneCO<sub>2</sub>. These results position the membraneless EMAR as a potentially promising approach for cost-effective and scalable point-source carbon capture.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Amines can capture CO<sub>2</sub> from flue gas but require energy-intensive regeneration.

In this process, CO<sub>2</sub> is separated through chemical reactions in the absorption column. The CO<sub>2</sub>-rich solution is then directed to the anode compartment of the electrochemical desorption unit, where the oxidation of the metal electrode and its subsequent complexation reaction with the absorbent releases the captured CO<sub>2</sub>. This stream is then sent to a flash tank for CO<sub>2</sub> removal and subsequently to the cathode for absorbent regeneration, where the metal center of the metal-absorbent complex is deposited back on the electrode. The CO<sub>2</sub>-lean stream is then returned to the absorption column for reuse (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Conventional and developed membraneless EMAR systems.</title><p><bold>A</bold> Process scheme of the conventional EMAR with a two-compartment electrochemical cell separated by an anion exchange membrane (AEM), illustrated as a dashed line.

The carbon-based GDE consists of a copper layer (Cu&#x02070;), a microporous layer (MPL), a gas diffusion layer (GDL), and a porous current collector (CC) facing the gas channel.

Various absorbent chemistries, including different amines and ammonia, were tested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, and different additives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> and electrode configurations were suggested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Key metrics such as energy consumption, CO<sub>2</sub> separation efficiency, and durability were monitored and optimized. Additionally, detailed thermodynamic analyses were conducted across a wide range of operating conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Despite these advancements, little to no attention has been given to modifying the process configuration (i.e., developing alternative configurations) and the anion exchange membrane (AEM) that separates the anode and cathode compartments. All previous studies have used the same configuration with an AEM, as illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>.</p><p id="Par7">A recent techno-economic analysis (TEA) of the EMAR process aimed to identify the capital expenditure (CapEx) required for components of the scaled-up process, including the electrochemical unit (electrodes, electrolyte, and AEM) and process equipment (such as compressors, pumps, condenser, etc.)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. The results indicated that the AEM significantly contributed to the overall CapEx, with the cost of the membrane largely dictating the total levelized cost of carbon capture. The function of the membrane in EMAR differs from that in other electrochemical systems, such as flow batteries. In a flow battery, an ion-selective membrane serves as a separator between the individual species of each electrolyte, ensuring that the redox species remain in their corresponding electrolyte tank<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. However, in EMAR, the AEM is essential for the efficient desorption of CO<sub>2</sub> in the anode chamber. If the membrane is removed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>), the desorbed CO<sub>2</sub> on the anode side would be reabsorbed by the regenerated amine on the cathode, resulting in the return of a CO<sub>2</sub>-rich stream to the absorption column, instead of the intended CO<sub>2</sub>-lean stream (as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). Thus, with the current EMAR configuration, removing the membrane would lead to a critically low cyclic capture capacity and desorption efficiency. Re-defining the EMAR configuration with the overall aim of eliminating the membrane while maintaining high desorption efficiency is necessary and offers substantial economic incentives, given the considerable cost of AEMs on the CapEx and capture cost.</p><p id="Par8">In this study, we developed a membraneless EMAR system by fundamentally re-designing the process configuration. A gas diffusion electrode (GDE), serving as a gas-breathing interface, was used as the anode to efficiently remove the desorbed CO<sub>2</sub> from the electrolyte before it could be reabsorbed in the cathode compartment. This innovation effectively eliminates the need for a membrane while potentially maintaining high desorption efficiency. Additionally, a similar GDE was employed as the cathode, providing a gas-breathing interface for the absorption of CO<sub>2</sub> from the gas mixture (e.g., flue gas), thereby logically eliminating the need for a separate absorption column. The system operates in a flow-by mode, where the flue gas flows parallel to the external surface of the GDEs. At the cathode, CO<sub>2</sub> is selectively absorbed into the amine solution, while at the anode, a separate sweeping gas facilitates the removal of desorbed CO<sub>2</sub>. This selective absorption of CO<sub>2</sub>, rather than other gases present in the flue gas (e.g., N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>), is primarily driven by the high chemical affinity between the amine and CO<sub>2</sub> at the electrode interface, precisely where the amine is continuously regenerated (Section S1 in the Supporting Information). Maintaining an optimized flow rate of the flue gas is critical to ensure sufficient CO<sub>2</sub> absorption while minimizing both unabsorbed CO<sub>2</sub> and the intrusion of other gases into the electrolyte. In addition, the hydrophobic coating on the external layer of the GDE (which is exposed to the gas phase) effectively prevents electrolyte leakage into the gas channel and bubbling gas into the electrolyte, ensuring stable operation and maintaining efficient gas-liquid separation. The proposed GDE configuration is analogous to those used in established electrochemical systems such as fuel cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, air-breathing batteries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, and CO<sub>2</sub> reduction cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, which utilize similar gas-liquid interfaces to facilitate efficient mass transfer.</p><p id="Par9">Unlike the conventional EMAR process, which mainly relies on convection for the mass transfer of various species, the new membraneless configuration relies on diffusion and migration. The transport of the copper-amine complex (Cu(EDA)<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>) and EDA-CO<sub>2 (aq)</sub> complexes to their respective electrodes is facilitated by a combination of electric forces (migration) and concentration gradients (diffusion). The cationic copper-amine complex is driven toward the cathode by the electric field, while the concentration gradient across the electrochemical cell promotes the diffusion of EDA-CO<sub>2</sub> (aq) towards the anode. These transport mechanisms are common in other electrochemical systems, such as thermochemical galvanic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>, microbial fuel cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>, and concentration cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>, where species migrate and diffuse under non-convective forces. As a result, the new system can operate in batch mode, eliminating the need for pumps to circulate the electrolyte (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). Overall, the new design not only eliminates the membrane as a major CapEx component but also removes other process equipment, including the absorption column, flash tank, and pumps, which collectively contributed approximately 40% of the CapEx of the conventional EMAR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. This streamlined design results in simpler configuration and operation and a significantly smaller footprint.</p><p id="Par10">Two types of GDE assemblies were developed: the &#x0201c;mesh-attached GDE,&#x0201d; where a metal mesh is mechanically attached to a porous carbon-based substrate with a hydrophilic layer facing the electrolyte and a hydrophobic layer on the back, and the &#x0201c;electrodeposited GDE,&#x0201d; where the metal is electrodeposited onto the same porous carbon-based substrate. The mesh-attached GDE is inspired by the conventional EMAR configuration, where a pure metal electrode is used, while the electrodeposited GDE is inspired by GDE-based electrochemical systems, such as those developed for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup> or air-breathing batteries. For all experiments, copper was used as the metal, and ethylenediamine&#x000a0;(EDA) as the absorbent, a combination that has been established as the benchmark for the EMAR process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par11">The primary goal of this investigation was to develop a membraneless system with high removal efficiency at high current density and low energy consumption.

Finally, a TEA was conducted to evaluate the economic performance and the levelized cost of carbon capture of the developed membraneless system in comparison to the conventional membrane-based EMAR process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Co<sub>2</sub> removal efficiency</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Mesh-attached GDE</title><p id="Par12">The CO<sub>2</sub> removal efficiency of the two mesh-attached GDEs, one assembled with a 50&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;50 mesh and the other with a 100&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;100 mesh, was evaluated across three different carbon-based substrates (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

This inefficiency likely originates from two sources: (1) a parasitic oxidation reaction occurring alongside the desired oxidation of copper on the anode electrode (i.e., Cu<sup>0</sup>&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;Cu<sup>2+</sup> + 2e<sup>&#x02212;</sup>), which is the primary driving force for the eventual desorption of CO<sub>2</sub>, and (2) the desorbed CO<sub>2</sub> at the anode interface (the mesh in this case) was not effectively collected in the gas channel behind the GDE. The former can be referred to as Faradaic inefficiency, and the latter as inefficient CO<sub>2</sub> collection. Previous studies have demonstrated that the EMAR system achieves nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency, indicating that almost all of the applied current is utilized for the intended copper redox reactions&#x02014;copper oxidation at the anode and reduction at the cathode&#x02014;without significant parasitic side reactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is likely that the primary source of removal inefficiency is due to inefficient collection rather than inefficient desorption.</p><p id="Par14">The inefficient CO<sub>2</sub> collection can be attributed to the presence of a microscale gap, or &#x0201c;microgap&#x0201d;, between the mesh and the carbon-based substrate, which is filled with the electrolyte. As the desorbed CO<sub>2</sub> travels through this wetted microgap, it is partially reabsorbed into the electrolyte, either by available free amines or hydroxide ions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Since CO<sub>2</sub> absorption by primary amines such as EDA (forming carbamate) is kinetically faster than by hydroxide (forming bicarbonate)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>, reabsorption by amine is likely the dominant pathway, given the short distance and brief time during which CO<sub>2</sub> traverses the electrolyte-filled microgap. Eliminating the microgap is challenging, as it is a consequence of the mechanical attachment of the mesh to the carbon-based substrate. Attempts to create a zero-gap electrode by mechanically pressing the materials at elevated pressures and temperatures were unsuccessful, as the fragility of the carbon paper resulted in its structural failure (Section S11; Supporting Information).</p><p id="Par15">The relative removal efficiencies of the different carbon-based substrates can be linked to their structural and morphological characteristics. The GDL 240 substrate is coated with a carbon black microporous layer (MPL) and a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) layer. Toray 060 has only a PTFE layer, while GDS 230 lacks both layers. Cross-sectional&#x000a0;Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images confirmed the presence of these layers (see Section S4 in the Supporting Information). These layers create resistance to CO<sub>2</sub> transfer through the material matrix.</p><p id="Par16">The differences in removal efficiencies between samples with different mesh sizes can be attributed to the variation in their thickness, which affects the travel distance and time for CO<sub>2</sub> from desorption at the anode interface to reaching the gas channels. The thickness of the 50&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;50 mesh (228&#x02009;&#x003bc;m) is twice that of the 100&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;100 mesh (128&#x02009;&#x003bc;m), resulting in CO<sub>2</sub> being exposed to the electrolyte for almost twice as long after desorption in the 50&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;50 mesh. This longer exposure increases the likelihood of CO<sub>2</sub> reabsorption mainly by amine as described earlier.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Electrodeposited GDEs</title><p id="Par17">Electrodeposited GDEs were prepared by depositing copper with specific loadings onto the three different carbon-based substrates.

The research was motivated by the significant contribution of membranes to the CapEx of conventional EMAR. Two types of GDE assemblies were investigated: mesh-attached and electrodeposited. Electrodeposited GDEs demonstrated superior performance over mesh-attached GDEs, achieving CO<sub>2</sub> removal efficiencies exceeding 90% compared to 35&#x02013;55% for mesh-attached GDEs. This improvement was attributed to the elimination of the microgap present in mesh-attached GDEs. This microgap caused inefficiency by allowing the reabsorption of desorbed CO<sub>2</sub> back into the electrolyte, a problem that was effectively resolved in the electrodeposited GDEs. However, for electrodeposited GDEs, the determining factor was the copper loading; higher copper loadings resulted in lower carbon removal efficiency due to the copper deposition layer acting as a physical barrier against CO<sub>2</sub> transport through the GDE. The relationship between copper loading and this barrier effect was confirmed by SEM and EDS analyses.

Sensitivity analysis and cost target analysis demonstrated the feasibility of achieving carbon capture costs as low as $50/tonneCO<sub>2</sub> with the membraneless EMAR system if the performance metrics (current density and removal efficiency) are further improved.</p><p id="Par32">Therefore, future research should focus on increasing current density while maintaining high carbon removal efficiency and low energy consumption. To enhance the current density of the membraneless EMAR system, several strategies can be explored. Electrode engineering techniques, such as surface modifications through acid, plasma, or thermal treatments, can improve electrode activity and stability. Optimizing the structure of the GDE, including refining the layer configuration and adjusting porosity, can significantly enhance mass transfer efficiency. Further improvements can be achieved by optimizing the cell geometry to promote uniform current distribution and minimize energy losses. Additionally, electrolyte optimization, whether by modifying the background electrolyte composition or introducing specific additives, can play a role in increasing the current densities. However, these strategies to improve current density may involve trade-offs with other performance metrics, such as absorption kinetics, energy consumption, and Faradaic efficiency. Therefore, a systematic investigation focused on enhancing current densities while maintaining other key performance metrics is necessary.</p><p id="Par33">Long-term cycling studies are also necessary to evaluate the performance stability of carbon substrates, particularly under continuous operation and varying conditions, such as fluctuating CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and electrolyte degradation. Investigating the durability of electrodeposited GDEs at higher copper loadings and their susceptibility to physical and chemical degradation over extended cycles is critical to ensure sustained performance. Furthermore, evaluating the resistance of the GDE to fouling, scaling, and operational stresses (e.g., mechanical stability under pressure) will provide insights into their long-term viability for industrial applications. Additionally, comprehensive optimization of electrodeposited GDEs, including pore size, porosity, and surface area, is crucial to fully understanding CO<sub>2</sub> desorption dynamics at the electrode-electrolyte interface.</p><p id="Par34">The impact of flue gas composition on the membraneless EMAR system&#x02019;s performance requires further investigation.

More details of the developed cell are provided in Section S6 of the Supporting Information.</p><p id="Par41">To conduct the desorption experiment, the electrodes were polarized at 1&#x02009;V using a potentiostat (VMP-300; Biologic) for 15&#x02009;min. The desorption experiments were conducted at room temperature (set at 22&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) using the chronoamperometry technique with a potentiostat (VMP-300; Biologic), applying a potential of 1&#x02009;V for 15&#x02009;min. This potential was determined to be the optimal value for the operation of the process (see Section S1 in the Supporting Information). This experimental duration was also sufficient to observe steady-state current density values and stable CO<sub>2</sub> desorption rates. This initiated the anodic reaction, leading to CO<sub>2</sub> desorption, and the cathodic reaction, regenerating the absorbent for further CO<sub>2</sub> absorption from the simulated flue gas. The current response of the system (<italic>I</italic>) was recorded using the built-in software (EC-Lab; Biologic), and all the experiments were conducted at room temperature (set at 22&#x02009;&#x000b0;C).
