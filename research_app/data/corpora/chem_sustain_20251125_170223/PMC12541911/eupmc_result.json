However, despite these advantages, their broad adoption remains constrained by the high costs associated with the synthetic methods commonly reported in the literature. The novelty of this study lies in its integrated approach, which combines activity-based costing, total cost of ownership, and green metrics (including percentage yield, stoichiometric factor, atom economy, and reaction mass efficiency). Using three illustrative case studies (TiO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, CeO<sub>2</sub>) it was shown that if the synthesis processes were considered cost alone, the TiO<sub>2</sub> resulted in the lowest total synthesis cost. Green metrics evaluation further reinforce the sustainability of TiO<sub>2</sub>. A comparative assessment of green metrics for TiO<sub>2</sub> and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> revealed that while TiO<sub>2</sub> and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> exhibit comparable atom economies (TiO<sub>2</sub>: 19.37%; Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>: 19.40%), TiO<sub>2</sub> achieves a higher percentage yield (97 vs 95%) and significantly outperforms Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in terms of stoichiometric factor (8.51 vs 25.77), indicating more efficient use of reactants and reduced chemical waste. Additionally, TiO<sub>2</sub> shows a marginally higher Kernel's Reaction Mass Efficiency (18.79 vs 18.43%). The findings indicate that low cost and efficiency are closely interconnected concerns in synthetic routes.", "affiliation": "Hephaestus Laboratory, School of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Democritus University of Thrace, GR 65404 Kavala, Greece.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic-eCollection", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Metals", "Sensitivity analysis", "Economic analysis", "Atom economy", "nanomaterials"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.5c06752"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12541911"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12541911?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2025-10-24", "firstIndexDate": "2025-10-24", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2025-10-24", "dateOfRevision": "2025-10-27", "electronicPublicationDate": "2025-10-07", "firstPublicationDate": "2025-10-07"}
