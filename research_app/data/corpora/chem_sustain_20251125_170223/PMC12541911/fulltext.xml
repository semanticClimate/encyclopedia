studied, as
they are regarded as the foundation of significant technological advancements
due to their promising properties. However, despite these advantages,
their broad adoption remains constrained by the high costs associated
with the synthetic methods commonly reported in the literature. The
novelty of this study lies in its integrated approach, which combines
activity-based costing, total cost of ownership, and green metrics
(including percentage yield, stoichiometric factor, atom economy,
and reaction mass efficiency). Using three illustrative case studies
(TiO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, CeO<sub>2</sub>) it
was shown that if the synthesis processes were considered cost alone,
the TiO<sub>2</sub> resulted in the lowest total synthesis cost. Green
metrics evaluation further reinforce the sustainability of TiO<sub>2</sub>. A comparative assessment of green metrics for TiO<sub>2</sub> and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> revealed that while TiO<sub>2</sub> and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> exhibit comparable atom economies
(TiO<sub>2</sub>: 19.37%; Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>: 19.40%), TiO<sub>2</sub> achieves a higher percentage yield (97 vs 95%) and significantly
outperforms Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in terms of stoichiometric
factor (8.51 vs 25.77), indicating more efficient use of reactants
and reduced chemical waste. Additionally, TiO<sub>2</sub> shows a
marginally higher Kernel&#x02019;s Reaction Mass Efficiency (18.79
vs 18.43%). The findings indicate that low cost and efficiency are
closely interconnected concerns in synthetic routes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><graphic xlink:href="sc5c06752_0009.jpg" position="float"/></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc-graphic"><graphic xlink:href="sc5c06752_0007.jpg" id="tgr1" specific-use="not-for-print" position="float"/></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>metals</kwd><kwd>nanomaterials</kwd><kwd>economic analysis</kwd><kwd>sensitivity analysis</kwd><kwd>atom economy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fnd-1"><funding-source>

that has seen remarkable
growth in recent years. The synthesis process is considered a critical
strategy for the successful discovery and development of new materials.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"/> In particular, nanometals have been the focus
of extensive research.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"/> Among various metals,
titanium dioxide,<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr"/> mesoporous alumina<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr"/> and cerium oxide<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr"/> have
attracted significant attention. For example, TiO<sub>2</sub> is valued
for its strong oxidation potential in pollutant decomposition, its
physical and chemical stability, and its relatively low cost and toxicity.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr"/> Similarly, mesoporous silica and mesoporous alumina
have gained considerable interest due to their high specific surface
area, large pore volume, and excellent stability.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr"/> Additionally, cerium oxide (CeO<sub>2</sub>), an important
rare earth metal oxide, has received increasing attention in recent
decades because of its wide-ranging applications in catalysis, pollution
reduction, and other fields. This is mainly due to its distinctive
redox behavior, which involves the storage and release of oxygen under
both oxygen-rich and oxygen-deficient conditions.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr"/>
</p><p>The synthesis of metal oxide nanoparticles with controlled
shape
and size is of both fundamental and technological importance. These
particles play a crucial role in understanding nanoscale physical
phenomena and are applied in various areas such as optics, catalysis,
energy, and microelectronics.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr"/> The desirable
properties of metal nanomaterials continue to drive efforts toward
developing cost-effective synthetic methods. A variety of methods,
both bottom-up and top-down, are used to create metal and metal oxide
nanomaterials. These techniques, such as wet chemical methods, hydrothermal
synthesis, templating, thermal decomposition, pulsed laser ablation,
microwave-assisted synthesis, chemical vapor deposition, combustion,
gas-phase techniques, sol&#x02013;gel processes, and solvothermal synthesis,
each have their own unique benefits and drawbacks.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr"/> Thus, the green and sustainable production of chemicals
is a critical element in the transition from a linear economy, which
consumes natural resources and degrades ecosystems, to a circular
economy that is resource-efficient and designed to eliminate waste.
To enable this transformation, reliable metrics are required to compare
the greenness and sustainability of competing technologies.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"/> Green chemistry metrics provide quantitative
tools for evaluating the environmental impact, efficiency, and sustainability
of chemical processes and products.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr"/>
</p><p>However, the discovery and optimization of synthesis protocols
for nanomaterials demand a highly skilled and trained workforce.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"/> In this context, synthesis strategies and conditions,
such as pretreatment, washing, and storage, can significantly influence
the overall cost of the process. Developing low-cost synthesis protocols
for nanomaterials remains a major bottleneck and is therefore an area
of ongoing research and development.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"/> There
is a clear need to develop low-cost synthesis methods that eliminate
the complexity associated with managing synthesis expenses. Although
the cost of synthesis is a significant concern, economic considerations
are often an afterthought during the initial stages of chemical synthesis
design.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr"/> While several established methodologies
exist,<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> recent research has primarily focused on
nanomaterial performance, with economic factors related to synthesis
cost seldom discussed in the scientific literature. To evade these
drawbacks, Gkika et al. proposed a cost model. Reflecting growing
scientific interest, one study carried out an economic analysis to
evaluate the effect of energy costs on the total synthesis cost of
membranes made from polymers of intrinsic microporosity.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr"/> In another study involving chitosan-based adsorbents,
labor cost was identified as the most significant contributor to the
overall synthesis cost.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr"/> Although these
studies set the precedent for reducing synthesis costs, the generalizability
of their findings is unclear. Each synthesis route may present distinct
economic vulnerabilities, which can ultimately increase the total
cost. Experimentally validated synthetic pathways can be compared
using quantitative metrics, such as yield and atom economy, or qualitative
factors, such as strategic design and novelty.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr"/> Considering these issues, and in light of the many confounding
variables involved, it is important to thoroughly understand the individual
cost factors that influence a synthetic process. Comparing different
nanomaterial synthesis routes using quantitative metrics is nontrivial.</p><p>Our goal is to create a measure of route efficiency in terms of
cost. Since this information is rarely available in a direct form,
we use various complexity metrics related to metal materials as a
surrogate. In our previous research, different synthetic routes of
the same material (rGO) were explored through synthesis.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr"/> Inspired by the intrinsic advantages of the
synthesis cost profile in this contribution, we further explore a
large economic scope of different metal nanomaterials and studied
their cost relationships. The primary objective is to establish an
integrated methodology that can elucidate the intricate economic and
environmental profiles of different metal oxide materials, while also
accounting for the complexities of their synthetic route characteristics.
The novelty of this work lies in its integrated framework, which combines
Activity-based costing (ABC) model,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr"/> Total
cost of ownership (TCO) model,<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr"/> and green
metrics to provide detailed insights into the key cost and environmental-driving
factors. This multidisciplinary approach is pivotal in synthetic processes,
as it encompasses the technologies and techniques employed, the sustainable
pathways to be considered, the associated economic costs, and the
environmental impacts, while employing a metal materials complexity
metric as a surrogate.</p><p>We began with an early stage economic
assessment using the TCO
model<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr"/> and activity based costing (ABC)
model.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr"/> These strategic cost management
tools measure the cost and efficiency of activities, helping to reveal
the dynamics behind three different synthesis routes. This comprehensive,
experimentally supported cost analysis offers crucial insights into
how various factors impact total synthesis costs, ultimately guiding
the selection of a specific metal nanomaterial. By evaluating the
cost implications of different synthetic outcomes, this analysis enables
the identification of a robust process-cost framework, which is essential
for implementing sustainable synthesis practices at the laboratory
scale. Additionally, we used the green metrics as a macro-level sustainability
strategy to assess efficiency aspects of the synthetic routes. This
method helps uncover how cost is influenced by changes in the choice
of metal nanomaterials, providing a clearer picture of the cost-efficiency
landscape. Overall, the proposed methodology has the potential to
significantly reduce synthesis costs while enhancing process efficiency.</p><p>This framework aims to provide a strategic management perspective
at the laboratory scale. The economic dimension, in particular, is
expected to act as a catalyst for a financially sustainable paradigm
shift. Strengthening the ability to assess cost implications and efficiency
will enhance research planning and enable informed perspectives on
nanomaterials development, thereby supporting future innovation. By
examining the relationship between cost and green metrics across diverse
materials, this comprehensive, experimentally based cost analysis
offers critical insights into how economic evidence yields viability
and sustainability in a synthetic pathway.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><p>The studied materials were

at the lab scale. The synthesis process is divided into two main categories:
(i) planning and (ii) design. It is further organized by tasks and
methods, outlining step-by-step activities for achieving the research
objectives. According to Gkika et al.,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr"/> the complexities of managing the synthesis process can only be fully
understood through activity-based costing (ABC) and other detailed
assessments. Furthermore, the application of green chemistry principles
(GCPs) can further enhance economic performance. GCPs can be grouped
into three main areas: Input selection and reduction encompasses 1
(waste prevention), 2 (atom economy), 7 (use of renewable feedstocks),
8 (reduction of derivatives), and 9 (catalysis). Sustainable design
involves 4 (designing safer chemicals), 6 (energy efficiency), and
10 (design for degradation).Safety management includes 3 (less hazardous
chemical synthesis), 5 (safer solvents and auxiliaries), 11 (real-time
pollution prevention analysis), and 12 (inherently safer chemistry
for accident prevention).<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr"/> The application

standpoint, ABC analysis, as described by Cooper and Kaplan,<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr"/> offers a viable alternative to traditional cost
accounting methods. Following Lewis,<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr"/> ABC
is defined as a technique that accumulates product costs by identifying
all activities necessary for manufacturing the product. Consequently,
the total cost of a product equals the sum of raw material costs and
the total costs of all production-related activities. ABC primarily
focuses on the root causes of indirect costs. Unlike traditional costing
methods, ABC defines cost categories as activities rather than production
cost centers.<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr"/> Additionally, the cost
drivers used to assign activity costs differ structurally from those
in conventional costing systems.<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr"/> According
to Cooper and Kaplan<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr"/> ABC can generally
be described as a two-step process. In the first step, activities,
such as processing material orders, marketing, or handling customer
orders, are identified. They require resources including personnel,
equipment, materials, and capital. The costs associated with each
activity&#x02019;s resource use are calculated based on resource cost
drivers. In the second step, ABC assigns these activity costs to the
relevant cost objects, such as products or services. To determine
the cost structure of an object, various activities are linked to
it through activity cost drivers. Thus, activity cost drivers and
resource cost drivers serve as the crucial connection between the
cost object, the associated activities, and the resources utilized.<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr"/>
</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3.4"><title>Supported Nanoparticle Cost Estimation and Input Parameter Choices
for TCO Model</title><p>This section outlines the calculation of each
cost component and the key input parameters used in modeling the synthesis
process. The analysis goes beyond chemical costs to include materials,
labor, maintenance and energy. Estimates were generated using Excel
(v16), with all assumptions and variables detailed in <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssuschemeng.5c06752/suppl_file/sc5c06752_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Supporting Information</ext-link>. Prices are reported in
Euros. A widely accepted definition of the TCO concept from<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr" specific-use="ref-style=base-text"/> provides a starting point:
TCO is an activity-based approach that utilizes principles of ABC
to identify and analyze costs. This definition highlights two main
aspects: (a) TCO is rooted in activity-based methodology, and (b)
it functions as a tool for cost analysis. This conceptual framework
underpins our research and is grounded in both academic rigor and
widespread recognition within the field. The total cost is the sum
of costs for materials, labor, accidents, energy, maintenance, and
depreciation. Raw material prices were estimated by combining vendor
quotations, publicly available and proprietary price databases, and
input from industry experts. Multiple sources were consulted to verify
and average each assumed price. To calculate precursor usage per gram
of product, both the amount of precursor used per synthesis and the
synthesis yield are needed. Precursor quantities were taken from published
protocols, while yield data, in grams of product, came from reported
sources. All synthesis protocols were taken from referenced literature.
Labor costs for synthesis were estimated either as the total hours
required to complete the process or as the actual active labor time.
It is important to distinguish between these two, since total hours
include activities like literature review, waiting times, and personnel
off-duty periods. Adding these extra hours inflates labor costs, so
this study considers actual active hours as the more accurate measure.
Maintenance and accident costs are detailed in <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssuschemeng.5c06752/suppl_file/sc5c06752_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Supporting Information</ext-link>. For accident costs, replacement expenses
were included in the calculations. Synthesis costs were estimated
using both ABC and TCO methodologies. The model is structured into

priorities in fine chemical research and academic settings, the efficient
use of reactants &#x02013; viewed through the lens of atom economy,
is frequently neglected.<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr"/> Atom economy,<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr"/> is a key principle of green chemistry and one
of the most widely used metrics for evaluating the efficiency of a
process or synthesis. This concept essentially measures the proportion
of reactant atoms that are incorporated into the final desired product(s).
Atom economy is not merely a theoretical idea but serves as a practical
guideline that helps scientists design and execute more efficient
syntheses. The concept was formalized by Sheldon,<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr"/> who defined atom economy as the percentage of atoms utilized,
calculated by dividing the molecular weight of the desired product
by the total molecular weight of all products generated in the reaction.<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr"/>

outperforms Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in terms of stoichiometric
factor (8.51 vs 25.77), indicating more efficient use of reactants
and reduced chemical waste. Additionally, TiO<sub>2</sub> shows a
marginally higher Kernel&#x02019;s Reaction Mass Efficiency (RME) (18.79
vs 18.43%), further supporting its favorable green profile. Although
Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> records a higher Curzon&#x02019;s RME (2.16
vs 0.73%), the overall evaluation underscores TiO<sub>2</sub> as the
greener material, particularly when emphasizing stoichiometric efficiency
and reaction yield &#x02013; two metrics of central importance in green
chemistry frameworks. The results illustrate the importance of directing
reaction design toward greener practices, where careful control of
stoichiometric balance facilitates increased reaction mass efficiency.</p><p>In recent years, numerous studies have emphasized the sustainability
performance of laboratory-scale nanomaterial production. While many
nanomaterials have been investigated, significant challenges remain
before their widespread adoption, particularly in reducing costs<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr"/> and mitigating the environmental impacts of
synthesis methods, both of which are central to sustainable chemistry
and engineering.<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr"/> Sustainability assessment
encompasses a comprehensive analysis of environmental, social, and
economic dimensions.<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr"/> Yet, balancing sustainability
with economic viability is a complex challenge. Material quality is
not solely determined by its performance, but also by the sustainability
and economic feasibility of the overall production process. In this
sense, sustainability itself can be considered a marker of product
quality.<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr"/>
</p><p>Earlier investigations
into sustainability and economic viability
considered the green synthesis of rGO nanocomposites. A central feature
of this strategy involved the use of guarana as a natural reducing
agent, combined with pomegranate biomass, to substitute conventional
reagents with biodegradable alternatives, thereby conferring ecological
and economic benefits. To quantitatively analyze the resource demands
and economic potential of different synthetic approaches, we implemented
a total cost of ownership-activity-based model.The most significant
characteristic of this synthetic approach is its integration of green
chemistry concepts with activity-based costing, which collectively
promote higher yields and greater sustainability throughout the critical
process steps. From an economic perspective, the streamlined method
demonstrated a significant cost reduction, achieving 19.48 &#x020ac;/g
(with three steps) compared to 248.64 &#x020ac;/g for the conventional
approach (with eight steps). This difference is largely attributed
to reduced consumption of chemicals and energy. Overall, the experimentally
driven cost analysis provided valuable insights into the factors influencing
total synthesis cost, helping to inform the selection of the most
efficient rGO nanomaterial production route.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr"/>
</p><p>Although there has been increasing interest in novel synthetic
methods for metal nanoparticles,<named-content content-type="bibref-group">

<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> metals and metal oxides have
not been sufficiently examined through the lens of Green Chemistry
principles. This gap largely stems from the fact that many studies
approach synthesis from the standpoint of novel phenomena, often without
clearly addressing end-use considerations.<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr"/> This study is pioneering in scope, as it integrates green chemistry
metrics with economic sustainability in the context of metal oxide
synthesis. It presents a two-dimensional sustainability assessment
of laboratory-scale metal oxide production processes through environmental
and economic analyses. The results highlight the importance of adopting
a holistic perspective when evaluating sustainability. The environmental
and economic performance revealed that titanium dioxide demonstrated
the strongest performance by substantially reducing the ecological
footprint of metal oxide synthesis and emerged as the most feasible
option.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.5"><title>Benefits</title><p>A clear advantage of our methodology is its
ability to provide insights into potential cost savings, while also
highlighting the actual needs and economic potential of various synthesis
routes. Drawing from the three case studies, and particularly when
examining accident-related costs, a noteworthy contradiction emerges.
This work aimed to test the hypothesis that common features in synthesis
routes might reveal recognizable patterns. The case of cerium oxide
demonstrated that raw material cost is the most influential factor
affecting its total cost of ownership (TCO). In contrast, for mesoporous
alumina and titanium dioxide, accident and labor costs were the primary
cost drivers, with raw material expenses playing a minimal role. These
differences point to the importance of tailoring cost-reduction strategies
to the specific material and synthesis process. Our modeling results
propose different ways to minimize synthesis-related costs. For example,
implementing safety training programs could significantly reduce accident-related
expenses. Conducting the reactions at room temperature helps lower
energy consumption and minimize safety risks compared to continuous
high-temperature methods. Additionally, using water as a solvent can
decrease both material costs and process hazards. An important observation
from this analysis is the absence of a consistent relationship between
cost factors across all materials. This suggests that synthesis costs
are strongly dependent on both the material type and the specific
synthesis approach, a point that merits further investigation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Conclusions and Future Prospects</title><p>In this study, an
economic model was developed and applied to various
metal nanomaterials to assess their economic feasibility. Sensitivity
analysis revealed that accident costs and raw material costs significantly
influence the economics of synthesis. The economic evaluation indicates
that understanding the primary cost drivers can make nanoparticle
synthesis more cost-competitive, paving the way for sustainable synthesis
and commercialization. Early stage economic analysis demonstrated
that investing in safety training can remove economic barriers and
enhance sustainability benefits compared to a lack of training. A
sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of different
input parameters, showing that accident costs are the largest contributor
for most nanomaterials, with potential cost variations ranging from
approximately &#x02212;3 to +14% relative to the baseline scenario.
The economic framework presented here could be extended to other nanomaterial
synthesis processes. Conducting early stage economic assessments of
synthesis cost factors provides valuable insights for informed decision-making
during scale-up. By integrating the ABC method, TCO model, and green
metrics (including percentage yield, stoichiometric factor, atom economy,
and reaction mass efficiency), this study highlights the importance
of combining experimental and economic data to effectively reduce
overall synthesis costs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="sifile1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><media xlink:href="sc5c06752_si_001.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ACK-d14e1108-autogenerated"><p>We acknowledge support of this work by the project
