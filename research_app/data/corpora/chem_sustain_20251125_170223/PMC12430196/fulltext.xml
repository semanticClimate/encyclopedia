Introduction</title><p>As global demand for safer, more sustainable food systems continues to rise, the analytical sciences are increasingly expected to contribute to environmental protection and the efficient use of resources. Growing environmental concerns have made sustainability a key objective across many scientific disciplines, including analytical chemistry. Traditional analytical methods play an essential role in ensuring food safety and quality, but they often involve the use of hazardous or even toxic solvents, generate large amounts of chemical waste, and require high energy consumption. These drawbacks contribute to environmental pollution and pose occupational health risks, especially in laboratories with high sample processing demands. To address these challenges, the concept of green analytical chemistry (GAC) has emerged. GAC focuses on reducing the environmental footprint of analytical processes by promoting the use of safer chemicals, minimizing waste, conserving energy, and improving method efficiency, without compromising analytical performance [<xref rid="B1-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>HPLC is widely used in food analysis due to its accuracy, sensitivity, and ability to detect and quantify a broad range of compounds, including nutrients, bioactive substances, contaminants, and residues, even at trace levels. Its broad analytical scope makes HPLC essential for quality control, authenticity testing, and ensuring compliance with food safety regulations [<xref rid="B3-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Despite its analytical advantages, conventional HPLC methods often rely on hazardous organic solvents, such as acetonitrile and methanol, generate large volumes of chemical waste, and consume considerable amounts of energy through the operation of pumps, detectors, and column ovens. These environmental drawbacks are particularly significant in laboratories that process high sample loads on a routine basis. As a result, the long-term sustainability of HPLC is increasingly being questioned, prompting efforts to develop greener chromatographic practices with enhanced resource efficiency [<xref rid="B5-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Promoting the application of green principles in HPLC has emerged as a strategic priority in analytical chemistry, driven by the need to reduce the environmental impact of chromatographic practices. GAC encourages the use of alternative solvents, reduction of reagent and sample volumes, energy-efficient instrumentation, and environmentally friendly sample preparation techniques [<xref rid="B8-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In this context, innovation plays a central role, driving the evolution of greener instrumentation, miniaturized systems, and integrated workflows. Recent innovations, such as micro-HPLC, hybrid extraction systems, and solvent-free workflows, have demonstrated the feasibility of aligning HPLC with GAC principles in both research and industrial settings [<xref rid="B11-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. To support the implementation of greener chromatographic practices, several greenness assessment tools have been introduced, including the Analytical Eco-Scale, the Green Analytical Procedure Index (GAPI), and the AGREE metric (Analytical GREEnness), each offering quantitative or semi-quantitative evaluations of the environmental performance of analytical methods [<xref rid="B9-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this review is to critically examine recent advances and innovations in green HPLC methodologies, with a particular focus on their applications in food analysis. It discusses how the principles of green analytical chemistry are being incorporated into chromatographic workflows, solvent selection, instrumental configurations, and regulatory approaches. In addition, it evaluates how the implementation of green strategies contributes to more sustainable food quality control and environmental responsibility, particularly in alignment with international legislative requirements and certification schemes [<xref rid="B12-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This review also highlights key methodological trends, technological developments, and greenness assessment tools that support the transition toward more environmentally friendly chromatographic practices. Ultimately, it seeks to facilitate the practical adoption of green HPLC solutions by synthesizing up-to-date scientific knowledge in a form accessible to researchers, practitioners, and industry stakeholders. The review primarily emphasizes literature from the last five years, while also including a limited number of earlier foundational studies essential for understanding green analytical chemistry and its application in HPLC.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-molecules-30-03573"><title>2. Principles of Green Analytical Chemistry</title><p>Green analytical chemistry is structured around twelve guiding principles that aim to reduce the environmental and human health impacts of analytical procedures while ensuring scientific robustness. These principles, first proposed by Galuszka et al. [<xref rid="B13-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], establish a structured approach to developing and assessing analytical methods with sustainability as a key consideration. A summary of these twelve principles is presented in <xref rid="molecules-30-03573-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. </p><p>Unlike traditional analytical approaches, which prioritize precision and selectivity often at the expense of environmental considerations, GAC integrates sustainability from the early stages of method development. This proactive approach supports both analytical performance and environmental responsibility [<xref rid="B14-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><sec id="sec2dot1-molecules-30-03573"><title>2.1. Greenness Assessment Tools in Analytical Chemistry</title><p>To evaluate the environmental performance of analytical procedures, several greenness assessment tools have been developed and widely adopted in recent years. The Analytical Eco-Scale provides a penalty-point-based system that quantifies the deviation from an ideal green method based on solvent toxicity, energy consumption, waste generation, and occupational hazards [<xref rid="B16-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Its simplicity and semi-quantitative nature make it particularly suitable for routine food analysis. In a recent study on phthalate detection in edible oils, the Eco-Scale was instrumental in highlighting the environmental drawbacks of conventional sample preparation methods involving large solvent volumes, while favoring miniaturized and solvent-free alternatives [<xref rid="B17-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>GAPI offers a visual, semi-quantitative evaluation that considers the entire analytical workflow, from sample collection to final determination, represented through a color-coded pictogram [<xref rid="B18-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Each segment of the pictogram reflects specific stages of the method, enabling users to quickly identify critical steps in terms of environmental impact. In the assessment of HPLC methods for paclitaxel, GAPI was effective in distinguishing between high- and low-impact procedures, emphasizing the role of solvent choice and detection mode as key differentiating factors [<xref rid="B19-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Recent advances have extended this approach with the development of the Complex-GAPI tool, which incorporates pre-analytical procedures and provides a more comprehensive evaluation of greenness [<xref rid="B20-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition to that, the Modified GAPI (MoGAPI) introduces a scoring system and a dedicated software for more precise and comparable assessments [<xref rid="B22-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The more recent AGREE metric, introduced in 2020, integrates all 12 GAC principles into a holistic algorithm, providing a single-score evaluation supported by intuitive graphic output [<xref rid="B9-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B23-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The AGREE chart assigns scores on a scale from 0 to 1, delivering a normalized assessment of key parameters, such as solvent toxicity, energy consumption, sample preparation complexity, and analytical throughput. The latter refers to a method&#x02019;s capacity to process high sample volumes efficiently, a critical consideration for routine laboratory workflows that directly impacts both sustainability and operational feasibility. This comprehensive evaluation enables rapid benchmarking and method optimization, while ensuring alignment with the principles of green chemistry. As such, AGREE is increasingly recognized as a robust and user-friendly tool for assessing the greenness of analytical procedures in both research and industrial settings [<xref rid="B23-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. More recently, the AGREEprep tool was introduced to specifically evaluate the greenness of sample preparation, addressing this critical step through ten assessment criteria and dedicated open-source software [<xref rid="B24-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. <xref rid="molecules-30-03573-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> provides a comparative overview of the major greenness assessment tools in analytical chemistry, summarizing their main characteristics, output formats, and distinctive features to facilitate direct comparison across different approaches.</p><p>These tools are not only theoretical constructs but are increasingly applied to assess and compare analytical procedures across various sectors. A recent bibliometric review of more than 100 studies confirmed a growing trend in the application of these metrics to optimize methods in food safety, pharmaceutical analysis, and environmental monitoring [<xref rid="B3-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Recently, a new complementary tool to greenness assessment metrics, the Blue Applicability Grade Index (BAGI), has been introduced to address the practical and operational aspects of analytical methods, in alignment with the emerging concept of method applicability evaluation, as introduced by the principles of white analytical chemistry (WAC) and its Red&#x02013;Green&#x02013;Blue (RGB) model [<xref rid="B25-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. WAC seeks to balance analytical performance, environmental sustainability, and practical applicability, illustrated by the RGB model where red corresponds to method performance, green to environmental aspects, and blue to applicability. A &#x0201c;white&#x0201d; method is therefore one that harmonizes all three dimensions. BAGI evaluates ten key attributes related to applicability, including analysis type, throughput, reagent availability, automation, and sample preparation, and provides both a numeric score and a visual &#x0201c;asteroid&#x0201d; pictogram. While tools like AGREE assess the environmental sustainability of a method, BAGI emphasizes its practical viability and usability in real-world settings, making it particularly relevant for routine food laboratories. Its adoption in recent case studies demonstrates its value in identifying both strong and weak aspects of analytical workflows, and it is expected to gain wide acceptance alongside existing green metrics.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-molecules-30-03573"><title>2.2. Application of GAC in Food Analysis</title><p>In food laboratories, where high sample throughput is common, the implementation of GAC principles offers clear advantages. These include reduced consumption of solvents and energy, enhanced occupational safety for analysts, and improved alignment with the requirements of green certification schemes [<xref rid="B26-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>The principles and tools of green analytical chemistry are increasingly applied in food analysis, a field that has traditionally depended on methods requiring large amounts of solvents and high energy consumption. Numerous studies have demonstrated the integration of GAC into sample preparation and chromatographic workflows for food matrices, employing green solvents such as ethanol and water, and minimizing hazardous reagent use [<xref rid="B17-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B26-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Techniques such as QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe) and solid phase microextraction (SPME) are being widely adopted for the extraction of residues and contaminants from complex food samples, offering high efficiency while reducing solvent consumption and waste generation [<xref rid="B17-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B26-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Visual assessment tools like GAPI and AGREE have been employed to evaluate the greenness of these methods across multiple food categories, including edible oils, fruits, dairy, and cereals [<xref rid="B3-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B19-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies demonstrate the value of combining green assessment tools with miniaturized and solvent-free techniques, such as stir-bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), to achieve both analytical reliability and environmental sustainability in food safety and quality control [<xref rid="B26-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. SBSE provides a rapid and solvent-minimized approach, while SFE has emerged as a sustainable extraction tool that replaces large volumes of organic solvents with supercritical carbon dioxide. Such advancements further demonstrate the relevance and growing importance of GAC in food laboratories, where high sample volumes and strict regulatory demands require greener, safer, and more cost-effective analytical solutions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-molecules-30-03573"><title>2.3. Integration with Quality by Design (QbD)</title><p>The role of QbD in GAC is also gaining recognition. QbD approaches enable the systematic optimization of chromatographic conditions and solvent compositions with respect to both performance and sustainability criteria. By integrating green metrics into method validation and lifecycle management, laboratories can ensure continuous improvement aligned with GAC goals [<xref rid="B27-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Recent studies highlight the synergy between QbD and GAC in optimizing method parameters using tools like analytical target profile (ATP), risk assessment (e.g., Ishikawa diagrams), and design of experiments (DoE) to enhance method robustness while minimizing environmental impact. Case studies in pharmaceutical and food analysis demonstrate that combining QbD with green metrics, such as GAPI, AGREE, and Eco-Scale, yields methods that are both analytically efficient and environmentally sustainable [<xref rid="B27-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Furthermore, international collaborations and regulatory agencies are increasingly encouraging the integration of GAC metrics into method development protocols, positioning them as essential tools for next-generation analytical chemistry [<xref rid="B28-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-molecules-30-03573"><title>3.

General Classes of Green Solvents</title><p>The substitution of conventional organic solvents such as acetonitrile, chloroform, and dichloromethane with greener alternatives is a fundamental approach in the development of environmentally sustainable chromatographic methods [<xref rid="B13-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B29-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Conventional solvents, despite their proven effectiveness in separation and detection, are associated with significant environmental and human health hazards due to their high volatility, toxicity, and persistence in ecosystems [<xref rid="B13-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To mitigate these impacts, extensive research has focused on the identification and validation of low-toxicity, biodegradable, and renewable solvents for use as mobile phase components or extraction media in HPLC applications. These solvents act by reducing the polarity mismatch with analytes, ensuring efficient solubilization and extraction while simultaneously lowering toxicity and environmental load.</p><p>Ethanol and water, either used individually or as binary mixtures, represent the most commonly adopted bio-based alternatives due to their minimal environmental footprint, suitable polarity, and widespread availability. Ethanol, in particular, has been successfully employed as a single solvent or co-solvent in reversed-phase HPLC for the separation of diverse analytes, including caffeine, catechins, and phenolic acids [<xref rid="B31-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

Emerging Green Solvent Systems</title><p>Natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) and ionic liquids (ILs) represent a new generation of green solvents that enable the development of solvent systems optimized for specific analytical needs. NADES are typically composed of naturally occurring components such as sugars, amino acids, and organic acids, forming eutectic mixtures with low melting points and adjustable polarity. These solvents are non-volatile, biodegradable, and often edible, making them highly attractive for food-related applications [<xref rid="B15-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B35-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Recent research demonstrates their compatibility with reversed-phase liquid chromatography, particularly for polar compound extraction from botanical and functional food matrices. Applications include the successful use of NADES for recovering phenolic compounds from fruit skins and peels, as well as flavor and aroma compounds from herbs and spices, highlighting their suitability across diverse food matrices [<xref rid="B15-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

The standard encourages laboratories to monitor and control their environmental aspects, such as chemical usage, waste generation, and energy consumption, through a structured cycle of planning, implementation, evaluation, and continuous improvement.</p><p>Green analytical chemistry complements ISO 14001 by offering practical strategies for reducing the environmental footprint of analytical activities. Techniques that minimize solvent use, reduce hazardous waste, and improve energy efficiency are directly aligned with ISO 14001 objectives. Moreover, green metrics and method selection criteria rooted in GAC provide quantifiable indicators that can be integrated into EMS documentation and performance evaluations [<xref rid="B143-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies have shown that laboratories adopting ISO 14001 benefit from enhanced environmental awareness, structured waste handling, and more sustainable laboratory workflows. The integration of GAC-aligned practices, such as the use of safer solvents and energy-efficient instrumentation, facilitates compliance with ISO 14001 and contributes to improved operational sustainability. Recent evaluations in clinical and analytical laboratory environments have shown clear improvements in environmental performance, including lower energy consumption, reduced chemical waste, and decreased operating costs [<xref rid="B144-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. Moreover, the environmental indicators emphasized in ISO 14001, such as solvent use, energy efficiency, and waste generation, are closely aligned with the evaluation criteria of green analytical practices, enabling coherent integration into EMS performance monitoring.</p></sec><sec id="sec5dot2-molecules-30-03573"><title>5.2. Integration of ISO 22000 and HACCP</title><p>Green HPLC practices are increasingly compatible with food safety management systems such as ISO 22000, which emphasize risk-based thinking, process integration, and continuous improvement through the plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle [<xref rid="B145-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. The standard has been built upon HACCP principles by organizing food safety protocols around preventive controls and verification mechanisms, which serve as effective entry points for incorporating green analytical tools [<xref rid="B146-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>].</p><p>Under ISO 22000, analytical procedures are integrated into prerequisite programs (PRPs), operational controls, and validation steps. The use of environmentally conscious chromatographic methods, such as those employing low-toxicity solvents or miniaturized formats, can enhance the effectiveness of these programs while also reducing environmental impact. The alignment of green analytical chemistry with ISO 22000 objectives supports both regulatory compliance and sustainable innovation [<xref rid="B147-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>].</p><p>A recent study on food facilities with multiple production lines demonstrated that the implementation of ISO 22000:2018 not only reduced non-compliance incidents by over 40%, but also improved operational indicators such as downtime and traceability [<xref rid="B148-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. The study highlighted the importance of analytical improvements, particularly in hazard analysis and monitoring, in achieving these outcomes. Integrating green HPLC into the verification of critical control points (CCPs) and supporting decision-making through reliable, low-impact analysis strengthens the connection between food safety and environmental performance.</p></sec><sec id="sec5dot3-molecules-30-03573"><title>5.3. ESG and GFSI Alignment</title><p>Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria are increasingly influencing the strategic orientation of stakeholders in the food industry, including analytical laboratories. ESG-related policies and performance indicators encourage the adoption of environmentally responsible practices such as energy efficiency, solvent reduction, and waste minimization. Within this context, GAC provides a practical approach to enhancing the environmental pillar of ESG performance, particularly in laboratories engaged in food safety and quality analysis. Recent literature highlights the growing significance of ESG disclosure in the agri-food sector and its alignment with broader sustainable development goals [<xref rid="B149-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>].</p><p>Given the rising importance of ESG criteria across sectors, the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) has emerged as a key driver in the global harmonization of food safety standards. Since its establishment in 2000, GFSI has developed into a comprehensive multi-stakeholder platform that benchmarks food safety certification programs, facilitates regulatory alignment, minimizes audit redundancy, and fosters trust across the food supply chain [<xref rid="B150-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. Contemporary GFSI-recognized certification schemes, including FSSC 22000, IFS, and BRC, increasingly incorporate environmental and sustainability considerations into their updated audit protocols, thereby expanding the scope of food safety systems to align with broader ESG objectives [<xref rid="B150-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>,<xref rid="B151-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>].</p><p>Surveys of certified food processors reveal broad support for GFSI&#x02019;s contribution to enhanced food safety practices, streamlined third-party auditing processes, and improvements in documentation and personnel training [<xref rid="B152-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. Moreover, the integration of GAC practices, such as solvent-free extraction techniques and energy-efficient instrumentation, within GFSI-certified operations can reinforce both food safety outcomes and ESG reporting effectiveness. This alignment contributes to the advancement of sustainable and transparent food systems, in line with the objectives promoted by the GFSI and its strategic focus on cultivating a strong food safety culture [<xref rid="B153-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, recent systematic reviews of ESG disclosure literature provide deeper insight into the theoretical foundations and emerging themes that guide ESG practices across industries, including the food sector. ESG disclosure is increasingly influenced by regulatory requirements, stakeholder expectations, and corporate governance mechanisms, all of which are directly relevant to food businesses aiming to align with global sustainability goals [<xref rid="B154-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. Additionally, ESG performance is influenced by a range of interrelated factors that increasingly intersect with food safety and analytical practices. These include stakeholder pressure, internal organizational capabilities, corporate governance structures, institutional context, and regulatory requirements [<xref rid="B155-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. Such factors influence how organizations incorporate ESG strategies into operational decision-making processes, including quality assurance and sustainability reporting. In the context of food sector certification, the alignment of GFSI practices with ESG drivers underscores the importance of adopting greener analytical workflows, not only to ensure compliance but also to promote environmental responsibility and strengthen market credibility. To provide an integrative overview, <xref rid="molecules-30-03573-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> summarizes the main green HPLC approaches in relation to their applications in food analysis and their alignment with regulation, certification, and sustainability.</p><p>As shown in <xref rid="molecules-30-03573-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, green HPLC approaches not only enhance analytical performance and environmental sustainability but also align directly with food safety regulations, certification schemes, and broader sustainability goals. This integrated perspective underlines the role of green HPLC as both a scientific and regulatory tool in sustainable food analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec6-molecules-30-03573"><title>6. Challenges and Future Perspectives</title><p>Although sustainable practices are increasingly being prioritized in analytical chemistry, the widespread adoption of green HPLC still faces multidimensional challenges. One of the primary limitations is the high initial cost of eco-friendly instrumentation and specialized equipment, which may deter small and medium-sized laboratories from transitioning to greener alternatives. Additionally, concerns regarding analytical performance, such as sensitivity or reproducibility when using greener solvents or miniaturized techniques, continue to limit full integration into routine workflows. The limited availability of validated green methodologies and standardized protocols further complicates adoption, particularly in regulated sectors such as food analysis.</p><p>The need for targeted training and capacity building is also critical, as laboratory staff must develop the skills required to implement and maintain advanced green HPLC techniques and equipment. Moreover, international cooperation and the sharing of best practices can help accelerate the development and harmonization of green HPLC protocols, particularly in regions where access to advanced technologies remains limited.</p><p>However, significant opportunities lie ahead. Automation and digitalization are rapidly transforming analytical laboratories, offering the potential to optimize processes, reduce resource consumption, and support real-time data monitoring for better decision-making. The integration of smart technologies can further enhance the sustainability and efficiency of HPLC systems. Recent studies demonstrate that NADES-assisted extraction combined with HPLC and machine learning can deliver highly efficient, automated solutions for complex analyte determination, while AI-driven method development can simultaneously optimize chromatographic performance and greenness [<xref rid="B156-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>,<xref rid="B157-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. These advances align with the broader concept of smart analytical chemistry&#x02014;integrating the principles of green, sustainable, and white analytical chemistry with emerging technologies and miniaturized platforms&#x02014;to accelerate innovation in food analysis [<xref rid="B158-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. In parallel, recent innovations in green analytical chemistry emphasize balancing analytical performance with environmental sustainability, including the incorporation of tools such as life cycle assessment to systematically evaluate the ecological footprint of chromatographic methodologies [<xref rid="B5-molecules-30-03573" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Together, these perspectives indicate that the future development of green HPLC will be driven by digital transformation, systemic sustainability assessments, and interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure both analytical robustness and measurable reductions in environmental impact. Looking forward, there is strong potential for the formal integration of green analytical chemistry principles into international food safety and quality standards. By embedding sustainability criteria into regulatory requirements and certification schemes, stakeholders across the food supply chain can be encouraged to adopt greener analytical practices as part of their compliance obligations. Collaborative efforts among scientists, regulators, and industry stakeholders will be essential to ensure that advancements in green HPLC methodologies translate into improvements in analytical performance and measurable reductions in environmental impact.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec7-molecules-30-03573"><title>7. Conclusions</title><p>Green innovations in HPLC represent a meaningful advancement toward the implementation of more sustainable analytical practices in food analysis. The use of low-toxicity and sustainable solvents, miniaturized system configurations, and energy-efficient instrumentation has demonstrated that reductions in the ecological footprint of chromatographic workflows are achievable without compromising analytical robustness. Moreover, the incorporation of green sample preparation techniques further enhances the sustainability of HPLC applications, particularly in the analysis of complex food matrices.</p><p>This review demonstrates that green HPLC is not only feasible but also effective, delivering measurable benefits for laboratories, the environment, and the broader food sector. As awareness increases and regulatory requirements continue to evolve, the broader implementation of green analytical strategies becomes both relevant and necessary. Integrating such approaches into food safety and quality control systems can contribute to the achievement of sustainability objectives, while also promoting methodological innovation and enhancing the resilience of analytical operations.</p><p>Ultimately, the advancement of green analytical chemistry in food analysis requires interdisciplinary collaboration. Coordinated efforts among analytical chemists, food scientists, instrument manufacturers, and regulatory bodies are essential for the development and implementation of robust, environmentally responsible methodologies. To support broader adoption, actions such as targeted training, method harmonization and standardization, and the inclusion of green criteria in regulatory requirements and certification schemes are also necessary. Strengthening these systemic supports will position green HPLC as an integral component of routine food safety and quality control, reinforcing both sustainability commitments and analytical excellence.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
