Critical examples include polyimide films in microelectronics, epoxy resins in transformers, silicone rubber on outdoor insulators, and polyolefins in power cables. These solid insulation materials have high resistivity, which provides reliable assurance of the safe operation of equipment and power grids. However, both their production and end-of-life disposal place an important environmental burden. In light of the growing prevalence of sustainability principles and circular economy concepts, researchers and industry experts are re-evaluating every stage of the insulation life cycle. This includes synthesis processes, raw materials, energy consumption, and generation of toxic by-products, alongside performance durability and health impacts during use. Ultimately, disposal or recycling methods must also be considered.", "affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing 102206, P.
