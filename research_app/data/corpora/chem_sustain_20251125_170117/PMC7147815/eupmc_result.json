Sustainable chemistry not only utilizes the principles of green chemistry, but also expands to incorporate economic, societal, and environmental aspects. This is further elucidated by the incorporation of life cycle assessment/thinking to include the raw material production, manufacture, processing, and use and disposal stages, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of the environmental and human health impacts attributed to a chemical. This contribution outlines an approach for the development of a preliminary framework for the sustainable synthesis of a chemical that is identified as an alternative for an existing chemical of concern. The framework is introduced concurrently with a case study for organophosphates that are selected as potential replacements for brominated flame retardants (BFRs). This framework is designed to apply existing knowledge of green chemistry to the synthesis of alternatives, along with its integration into Life Cycle Assessment culminating in the development of a more overall sustainable chemical entity when compared to its predecessor.", "affiliation": "United States Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development, National Risk Management Research Laboratory, Land and Materials Management Division, 26 W.
