In contrast, storage of energy to a large extent still relies on heavy metals in batteries. Especially when built from biomass&#x02010;derived organics, organic batteries are promising alternatives and pave the way towards truly sustainable energy storage. First described in 2008, research on biomass&#x02010;derived electrodes has been taken up by a multitude of researchers worldwide. Nowadays, in principle, electrodes in batteries could be composed of all kinds of carbonized and noncarbonized biomass: On one hand, all kinds of (waste) biomass may be carbonized and used in anodes of lithium&#x02010; or sodium&#x02010;ion batteries, cathodes in metal&#x02013;sulfur or metal&#x02013;oxygen batteries, or as conductive additives. On the other hand, a plethora of biomolecules, such as quinones, flavins, or carboxylates, contain redox&#x02010;active groups that can be used as redox&#x02010;active components in electrodes with very little chemical modification. Biomass&#x02010;based binders can replace toxic halogenated commercial binders to enable a truly sustainable future of energy storage devices. Besides the electrodes, electrolytes and separators may also be synthesized from biomass. In this Review, recent research progress in this rapidly emerging field is summarized with a focus on potentially fully biowaste&#x02010;derived batteries.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p>

They foresaw that the &#x0201c;consideration of renewable resources in designing electrode materials could potentially enable the realization of green and sustainable batteries within the next decade.&#x0201d;<xref rid="cssc201903577-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> Since then, significant advancements have been made, and several concepts of green and sustainable batteries have been presented. Now, more than one decade later, it is time to evaluate developments and future trends in the field of battery materials made from renewable resources. This Review will summarize major accomplishments and give an outlook to future sustainable biomass&#x02010;derived batteries.</p><p>The need for renewable sources of energy is well&#x02010;known and has long been identified as a possible way out of today's oil dependency.<xref rid="cssc201903577-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> For truly sustainable usage of renewable energy, however, devices for energy storage should also be as benign as possible, for example, by being made of sustainable materials. In contrast to nonrenewable sources of energy (chemicals that release energy upon burning), which can rather easily be stored in tanks and used when needed, renewable sources of energy predominantly produce electrical energy, which requires more sophisticated storage devices. Importantly, not only off&#x02010;grid devices, such as cellphones and cars, necessitate such advanced devices for the storage of electrical energy, but the fluctuating availability of renewable electrical energy depending on the weather or time of day (in the case of windmills and solar panels, respectively) additionally demands for advanced grid storage of electrical energy. Common storage devices in this regard are supercapacitors and batteries, with batteries usually enabling higher energy density at the expense of power density.</p><p>When talking about sustainable battery materials, the concept of sustainability in chemistry needs to be discussed first.<xref rid="cssc201903577-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> It includes not only the principles of green chemistry, as introduced by Anastas and Warner,<xref rid="cssc201903577-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> but also aspects like water purification, alternative energies, exposure control of chemicals, and others.<xref rid="cssc201903577-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> In general, chemistry can only be considered sustainable if&#x02014;adapted from a United Nations definition of sustainable development&#x02014;it &#x0201c;meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs&#x0201d;;<xref rid="cssc201903577-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> that is, fossil resources are not being depleted, the environment is not being polluted, and feedstocks are completely renewable and not overused. A sustainable chemical process should be environmentally benign, economical in its use of resources, techniques, and industrial feasibility, and socially responsible, whereas a sustainable chemical material should be environmentally benign throughout its full lifecycle, including mining, usage, and recycling. It should furthermore be economical during fabrication, distribution, usage, and recycling, as well as being produced and used in a socially responsible way. To some extent, side products of contemporary industries, such as sulfur as a waste product from petrochemical industry, might also qualify as rather sustainable raw materials.</p><p>Larcher and Tarascon discussed the concept of sustainability for batteries.<xref rid="cssc201903577-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> The impact of a cell not only depends on the chemical composition but is the sum of the impacts of chemical composition, synthesis process, implementation in the system, and recycling. Commercial lithium&#x02010;ion batteries usually fail such sustainability criteria. They typically comprise powdered heavy metal&#x02010;containing inorganic active materials in the electrodes (often obtained under questionable conditions in developing countries), very thin membranes to separate cathode from anode, and highly flammable carbonate&#x02010;based electrolytes that form a resistive solid&#x02013;electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the electrodes, leading to heat generation in operation.<xref rid="cssc201903577-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> This setup inherently imposes dangers during malfunction, and even though the always&#x02010;implemented battery monitoring system usually prevents problems during operation, battery fires are omnipresent problems that can often be encountered in the media. Moreover, recycling of lithium&#x02010;ion batteries is not a widely established process yet,<xref rid="cssc201903577-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> and production as well as operation results in significant greenhouse gas emissions.<xref rid="cssc201903577-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>
</p><p>Many approaches have been described for increasing the sustainability of battery materials, which have usually tackled individual aspects such as composition,<xref rid="cssc201903577-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="cssc201903577-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> recycling,<xref rid="cssc201903577-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> and implementation. For example, intense efforts have been made to replace cobalt in LiCoO<sub>2</sub> cathodes by more abundant elements because of socio&#x02010;economic and ecological concerns, as well as limited supply and limited full cell potential. Higher cell potential alongside more sustainable cathode materials have been achieved for example by moving from layered oxides, as in LiCoO<sub>2</sub>, towards certain phospho&#x02010;olivines or spinel oxides. These more available inorganic cathode (and also anode) materials may be obtained by using biotemplates,<xref rid="cssc201903577-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, <xref rid="cssc201903577-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="cssc201903577-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> biomineralization,<xref rid="cssc201903577-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> and other low&#x02010;temperature processes.

Although fossil oil and gas have been formed from biomass a long time ago, their supply is limited on a shorter timescale. Hence, truly sustainable organic materials should not rely on petrochemicals but be made from regrown resources. Most reports about organic electrodes, however, which describe sophisticated new compounds, usually made from oil&#x02010;based chemistry, fail the aforementioned definition of sustainable chemistry. More sustainable organics should be desirable, but, in many reports, concerns about sustainability are subordinate to performance.</p><p>In general, organic electrode materials for batteries may be classified as n&#x02010;type (in which the neutral state can be reduced to a negatively charged state), p&#x02010;type (in which the neutral state can be oxidized to a positively charged state), or b&#x02010;type (in which the neutral state can both be reduced to the negatively charged state and oxidized to the positively charged state), depending on their redox reactions. In principle, n&#x02010;, p&#x02010;, and b&#x02010;type organics may be used as cathode or anode material. Because of stability reasons and redox potential, p&#x02010;type organics however are only used in organic cathodes, whereas n&#x02010; and b&#x02010;type organics may be used in both electrodes.<xref rid="cssc201903577-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> In nature, n&#x02010;type redox reactions are more common than p&#x02010;type redox reactions, meaning that biomolecules can, in principle, be used in both electrodes of a battery.</p><p>Another means by which to classify organic electrode materials is by their redox chemistry. Different redox mechanisms are present in conjugated systems, carbonyl compounds, stable radical containing compounds, organodisulfides, and thioethers. Out of these, only some carbonyl and possibly some sulfur&#x02010;containing compounds are directly available from biomass. All other classes of material need to be synthesized from petrochemical precursors, or require harsh, unsustainable modifications of biomass&#x02010;derived chemicals and are, as such, not as sustainable as chemicals that are directly available in regrown biomass or can be synthesized from biomass in benign reactions.</p><p>In this Review, organic battery components may only be considered sustainable if they can be made from biological resources in a sustainable way, and if they can be implemented in cells in a benign process. Chemicals made from oil or other fossil fuels shall not be considered bioderived herein, even though of course their feedstocks were also formed from biomass millions of years ago. Although nowadays a vast variety of small molecules can be produced from regrown biomass by using only biological reactions,<xref rid="cssc201903577-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">44</xref> only some are redox&#x02010;active and may hence find application in sustainable electrodes. Other biomass&#x02010;based small molecules may be used to synthesize different parts of sustainable batteries, such as binders or electrolytes. In energy storage devices relying on a combination of such materials, the full carbon cycle is maintained (Figure&#x02005;<xref rid="cssc201903577-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Ideally, biomass&#x02010;based batteries power machines, which generate CO<sub>2</sub>, which is transformed into biomass in plants, which is used to make batteries again. Additionally, batteries that reached the end of their usability may be decomposed biologically or incinerated, releasing the constituents back to the environment to ideally form new biogenic chemicals in a natural way.

The main advantage of this arrangement is that it impedes the formation of dendrites.

Even more importantly, in the context of this Review, the authors also investigated the electrochemical stability and found it to be in the expected range for imidazolium ionic liquids (see Figure&#x02005;<xref rid="cssc201903577-fig-0021" ref-type="fig">21</xref> and below).

The reason is that the oxidative and thermal stability of sustainable ionic liquids, which are free of halogens, are often lower than those of specially designed ionic liquids with fluorinated groups. Furthermore, even such high&#x02010;performance ILs have some disadvantages compared to carbonate&#x02010;based solvents (they are usually more viscous and have lower ionic conductivities, owing to sluggish diffusion of larger ion clusters).<xref rid="cssc201903577-bib-0374" ref-type="ref">374</xref> It is worth noting that the limited oxidative stability of sustainable ionic liquids is not limited to carboxylate anions, but also ILs with different other halogen&#x02010;free anions possess limited oxidative stability.<xref rid="cssc201903577-bib-0450" ref-type="ref">450</xref> Additionally, the interplay between all battery components of conventional batteries has been continuously optimized, making it difficult to exchange one species with a chemically very different one (e.g., a carbonate&#x02010;based solvent with an ionic liquid in general and a sustainable ionic liquid in particular).</p><p>One further property that impedes application of many ionic liquids in electrolytes is, ironically, often their high range of electrochemical stability. Modern lithium&#x02010;ion batteries require the formation of an SEI layer on the electrodes by partial electrochemical decomposition of the electrolyte system. A high reductive stability of an ionic liquid may prevent this formation, which in turn increases safety concerns rather than decreasing them.<xref rid="cssc201903577-bib-0371" ref-type="ref">371</xref> In this regard, biomass&#x02010;based ionic liquids may be more appealing for actual applications than other ionic liquids as their range of electrochemical stability is often smaller than in other ionic liquids but still comparable to some organic solvents. For example, 1,3&#x02010;bis[(tetrahydrofuran&#x02010;2&#x02010;yl)methyl]imidazolium acetate, which is a completely bioderived symmetrical imidazolium ionic liquid with a tetrahydrofurfuryl group as each <italic>N</italic>&#x02010;substituent and an acetate counterion, has an electrochemical stability range of approximately 3.6&#x02005;V and is not stable vs. lithium metal (as most imidazolium ionic liquids in which no protecting group is introduced at the carbon between both nitrogen atoms).<xref rid="cssc201903577-bib-0441" ref-type="ref">441</xref> As such, it may be suitable in electrolytes of secondary lithium batteries but has not been investigated yet, as is also the case for any imidazolium ionic liquid synthesized in the sustainable manner described above.</p><p>It has to be noted that in sustainable imidazolium ionic liquids, the introduction of protecting groups at the carbon atom between the two nitrogen atoms (R<sup>2</sup> in Scheme&#x02005;<xref rid="cssc201903577-fig-5002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>&#x02009;b), which would lead to increased reductive stability, is difficult by the sustainable synthesis route described above (R<sup>2</sup> is usually a proton).<xref rid="cssc201903577-bib-0440" ref-type="ref">440</xref> If a higher reductive stability is necessary, for example in batteries in which an SEI layer must not be formed (e.g., in magnesium batteries<xref rid="cssc201903577-bib-0451" ref-type="ref">451</xref>), such ILs may consequently not be used as such.

Using all kinds of biowaste or biogenic chemicals, carbons have been synthesized with the possibility to tune properties such as porosity or conductivity. Consequently, basically all biomass on Earth may possibly find use in battery applications in the future, either in the form of biomass&#x02010;based specialty materials or as precursors for fine chemicals or carbons. Although it goes without saying that inorganic materials are often preferable when it comes to high&#x02010;voltage or high&#x02010;energy&#x02010;density applications, drawbacks in terms of their sustainability may be completely circumvented by switching to fully bio&#x02010;derived energy storage devices in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="cssc201903577-sec-0038"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>
