Introduction</title><p>Due to the increasing structural complexity of drug molecules, the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) generally involves very high costs due to the large number of synthetic steps often involved and also due to the very stringent purity requirements imposed by regulatory agencies. For the same reasons, API synthesis is also associated with the generation of large amounts of chemical waste, and the E-factor (a green metric defined as the mass of product to mass of waste ratio) associated with the pharmaceutical industry is higher than that corresponding to all other fine chemical industries [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. To change this situation significantly, API synthesis needs to be made more efficient, particularly in terms of step economy and avoidance of intermediate isolation and purification steps.</p><p>Most current strategies for drug synthesis are based on linear schemes, which are rather inefficient in terms of time, costs, and waste generation. One way to improve this situation would be the introduction of multiple bond-forming transformations as key steps in drug synthesis, since they are usually able to generate high molecular complexity in a single step, representing significant progress towards the goal of the &#x0201c;ideal synthesis&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B2-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Among them, multicomponent reactions (MCRs), i.e., those that involve at least three starting materials that contribute all or most of their atoms to the final product, have attracted much attention in recent years. Their advantages over multistep protocols include a higher synthetic efficiency and a reduction in waste generation due to their high atom- and step-economy, which allows for a lower consumption of solvents in the extraction and purification stages.</p><p>In this context, we summarise here the progress made towards the preparation of active pharmaceutical ingredients by routes that involve a multicomponent reaction as the key step. Although there have been some previous reviews on the use of MCRs in the synthesis of bioactive compounds in general [<xref rid="B3-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], to our knowledge this is the first one to comprehensively focus on API preparation. We have organised the material according to the reaction that constitutes the key step of each synthesis and, with very few exceptions, we discuss only compounds that have at least reached clinical investigation status.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-pharmaceuticals-15-01009"><title>2. Imine-Initiated Multicomponent Reactions</title><sec id="sec2dot1-pharmaceuticals-15-01009"><title>2.1. Strecker Reaction</title><p>The reaction between amines, aldehydes, or ketones and a cyanide salt is one of the classical reactions in organic chemistry and holds the distinction of being the first multicomponent reaction described in the literature. It was reported in 1850 by Adolph Strecker, who described the reaction of an aqueous solution of ammonia, acetaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide to yield an &#x003b1;-amino nitrile derivative, whose hydrolysis afforded alanine. Remarkably, this was also the first synthesis of an amino acid, achieved before the availability of methods to isolate them from natural sources. The Strecker reaction is still a valuable tool to prepare natural and non-natural amino acids, as well as intermediates in the synthesis of complex heterocycles, including natural products [<xref rid="B9-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Some methodologies that have been shown to afford improvements of the Strecker reaction include ultrasound irradiation [<xref rid="B10-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and mechanochemical activation [<xref rid="B11-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The commonly accepted mechanism of the Strecker reaction (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-15-01009-sch001" ref-type="fig">Scheme 1</xref>) starts with the acid-promoted condensation of the amine with the carbonyl compound, affording an imine species (protonated in the acidic medium) with concomitant loss of a water molecule. The cyanide group then attacks the iminium intermediate through a Mannich-like mechanism to give the corresponding &#x003b1;-amino nitrile. In the initial step, a competition exists between cyanide and ammonia for the electrophilic carbonyl carbon, and the kinetic product is a cyanohydrin. However, its formation is reversible under the reaction conditions and the equilibria are eventually displaced towards &#x003b1;-aminonitrile formation [<xref rid="B12-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. </p><p>The Strecker reaction represents a useful tool for the synthesis of some families of opioid analgesics that are structurally characterised by the presence of a 4-aminopiperidine-4-carboxylic ester moiety. For example, early in the 1990s, Feldman and Brackeen published a simple synthesis of carfentanil (<bold>3</bold>), an opioid 27 times more potent than fentanyl used in veterinary medicine and as a recreational drug, based on this chemistry [<xref rid="B13-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The route was initiated by the reaction of <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-benzyl-4-piperidinone with aniline and trimethylsilyl cyanide, which furnished the racemic &#x003b1;-aminonitrile <bold>1</bold>. This reaction was found to proceed in better yields when performed in anhydrous conditions and in the presence of glacial acetic acid due to the low stability of <bold>1</bold> in aqueous acidic conditions. A six-step route, involving the formation of an hydantoin intermediate <bold>2,</bold> completed the synthesis of carfentanil. Remifentanil <bold>4</bold>, a related opiate analgesic, has been obtained using the same strategy (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-15-01009-sch002" ref-type="fig">Scheme 2</xref>).</p><p>Most &#x003b1;-aminonitriles of relevance as intermediates in API synthesis are chiral, and their preparation in enantiomerically pure form is often achieved by diastereoselective Strecker reactions starting from chiral starting materials. One example can be found in the first total synthesis, unveiled by the Corey group, of the anticancer natural product trabectedin (ecteinascidin-743), commercialised under the brand name Yondelis<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> for the treatment of advanced soft-tissue sarcoma and ovarian cancer. The chemical structure of this alkaloid is highly complex, since in addition to the characteristic pentacyclic template of the tetrahydroisoquinoline family of natural products, a further tetrahydroisoquinoline moiety is attached to the B-ring by a 10-linked lactone. As shown in <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-15-01009-sch003" ref-type="fig">Scheme 3</xref>, the reaction of aldehyde <bold>5</bold> and tetrahydroisoquinoline derivative <bold>6</bold> in the presence of potassium cyanide using acetic acid afforded &#x003b1;-aminonitrile <bold>7</bold>, from which the complex polycyclic scaffold of trabectedin was built in 17 additional steps [<xref rid="B14-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>An early example of a bioactive natural product synthesis based on a Strecker reaction can be found in the work by Stork et al. on reserpine, a natural antiadrenergic compound introduced in clinical practice in the 1950s as an antihypertensive agent. Although, due to safety issues, it has been progressively replaced by newer drugs, it is still employed, in combination with diuretics, when more usual treatments fail. A diastereoselective synthesis of this drug, in racemic form, has as the key step the treatment of aldehyde tosylate <bold>8</bold> with 6-methoxytryptamine and potassium cyanide, which led to the formation of cyanopiperidine <bold>9</bold> in high yield. This Strecker product was transformed into (&#x000b1;)-reserpine <bold>10</bold> by a simple Pictet-Spengler cyclisation in acidic conditions, with concomitant cyanide elimination [<xref rid="B15-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-15-01009-sch004" ref-type="fig">Scheme 4</xref>). </p><p>Although it is not strictly a multicomponent reaction since two partners (the amine and carbonyl groups) are part of the same molecule, we will mention one example of an intramolecular Strecker reaction. Sun, Xu, et al. developed a method to synthesise 3,4-disubstituted proline derivatives serving as suitable substrates for intramolecular Strecker reactions and applied this strategy to the synthesis of the hepatitis C virus protease inhibitor telaprevir [<xref rid="B16-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus, a five-step route starting from anhydride <bold>11</bold> afforded the <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-protected aldehyde intermediate <bold>12</bold>, which was reacted with trifluoroacetic acid to deprotect the amine and trimethylsilyl cyanide to furnish the &#x003b1;-aminonitrile product as a mixture of diastereomers <bold>13</bold> and <bold>14</bold>. The hydrolysis of this mixture afforded the corresponding &#x003b1;-amino acid <bold>15</bold> as a single diastereomer, and this compound was coupled with amine <bold>16</bold> to yield <bold>17</bold>, that was converted into telaprevir through a three-step sequence (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-15-01009-sch005" ref-type="fig">Scheme 5</xref>). This procedure allowed for the synthesis of telaprevir with an overall 16% yield over 11 steps.</p><p>The use of a chiral auxiliary to obtain enantiomerically pure Strecker products is illustrated by the synthesis of saxagliptin, an oral antidiabetic drug belonging to the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-IV) inhibitors class. The synthetic route developed by Hamann&#x02019;s group [<xref rid="B17-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] involves an asymmetric Strecker reaction between the adamantane-derived aldehyde <bold>18</bold>, (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>)-(&#x02212;)-2-phenylglycinol <bold>19</bold> and potassium cyanide in the presence of sodium bisulfite, that affords the corresponding homochiral aminonitrile derivative <bold>20</bold> with good yields and excellent enantioselectivity. Seven additional steps, including the removal of the chiral auxiliary, were required to complete the synthesis of saxagliptin (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-15-01009-sch006" ref-type="fig">Scheme 6</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we will discuss the use of chiral catalysts for enantioselective Strecker reactions as key steps in drug synthesis. Bajaj et al. published in 2012 an efficient synthesis of (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-clopidogrel, an antiplatelet drug widely used in the prevention of ischemic events in patients with atherosclerosis, based on a new asymmetric Strecker reaction [<xref rid="B18-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Briefly, they optimised a procedure by which different aliphatic or aromatic aldehydes could react with secondary amines and trimethylsilyl cyanide in the presence of a hydroquinine derivative as a chiral catalyst and sodium fluoride to improve the reactivity of (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>SiCN, yielding the corresponding &#x003b1;-amino nitriles with good yields and enantiomeric excesses. To exemplify the utility of this new protocol, they efficiently transformed 2-chlorobenzaldehyde and 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-<italic toggle="yes">c</italic>]pyridine <bold>21,</bold> in the presence of catalyst <bold>22</bold>, into intermediate <bold>23</bold>. This compound was hydrolyzed to the corresponding carboxylic acid <bold>24</bold> and then transformed into (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-clopidogrel bisulfate by a Fischer esterification followed by salt formation (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-15-01009-sch007" ref-type="fig">Scheme 7</xref>). This synthetic pathway achieved a remarkable shortening of the overall process when compared to the previously available multistep routes [<xref rid="B19-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>DPC-083 is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor that reached phase II clinical trials for the treatment of HIV infection. The group of Ma accomplished its enantioselective synthesis by using an in-house developed organocatalytic Strecker reaction [<xref rid="B22-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This protocol starts from imine <bold>25</bold> and trimethylsilyl cyanide in the presence of a bifunctional cinchonine-derived thiourea chiral catalyst (<bold>26</bold>), affording the intermediate (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>)-<bold>27</bold> with excellent yield and enantioselectivity. Then, reduction of the nitrile group to an aldehyde, a Wittig reaction that gave a <italic toggle="yes">cis</italic> alkene as the major product, double bond isomerization by treatment with iodine followed by benzoyl peroxide (BPO) and a final N-deprotection step allowed the synthesis of DPC-083 <bold>28</bold> in an acceptable overall yield (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-15-01009-sch008" ref-type="fig">Scheme 8</xref>). No racemization of the quaternary stereogenic center was observed during the last steps of the process.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-pharmaceuticals-15-01009"><title>2.2. Bucherer-Bergs Reaction</title><p>The reaction of aldehydes or ketones, potassium cyanide and ammonium carbonate to yield 5-substituted or 5,5-disubstituted hydantoins is known as the Bucherer-Bergs reaction [<xref rid="B23-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], after Hermann Bergs, the first chemist who formally described it in a patent [<xref rid="B24-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and Hans Theodor Bucherer, who developed the conditions and applications of this method [<xref rid="B25-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Previously, Ciamician and Silber had observed in 1905 the formation of 5,5-dimethylhydantoin from a mixture of acetone and hydrocyanic acid exposed to sunlight for a period of five to seven months [<xref rid="B26-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Although the reaction works well with aliphatic or aromatic aldehydes and most ketones, when compared with other methods for hydantoin synthesis [<xref rid="B27-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], it presents the drawback of showing only one point of variability, the C-5 position. Some modifications have been proposed to overcome reaction failures or improve yields, including ultrasonication of the reaction medium [<xref rid="B28-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], the Hoyer modification, consisting of carrying out the reaction under a CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere at high pressures [<xref rid="B29-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], flow chemistry [<xref rid="B30-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and mechanochemical activation [<xref rid="B31-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>The Bucherer-Bergs and Strecker reactions start similarly: the carbonyl compound condensates with ammonia, generating an imine suitable to receive an addition of cyanide. The resulting &#x003b1;-amino nitrile reacts with CO<sub>2</sub>, arising from ammonium carbonate, to form a carbamic acid intermediate <bold>29</bold>, which undergoes a spontaneous cyclisation to yield the 5-iminooxazolidin-2-one <bold>30</bold>. Ring opening of this new species gives the corresponding isocyanate <bold>31</bold>, which is transformed into the final hydantoin product through a second cyclisation by addition of the amino group to the isocyanate [<xref rid="B23-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-15-01009-sch009" ref-type="fig">Scheme 9</xref>).</p><p>The most recognizable API that can be obtained through a Bucherer&#x02013;Bergs reaction is phenytoin. The multicomponent synthesis of this popular drug, widely used as an antiepileptic drug, was first described in a patent from 1946 by reaction between benzophenone, ammonium carbonate and potassium cyanide in 60% aqueous ethanol. Alternatively, the reaction of benzophenone, potassium cyanide, and ammonium carbonate in an autoclave at 110 &#x000b0;C for 48 h gave phenytoin in nearly quantitative yield (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-15-01009-sch010" ref-type="fig">Scheme 10</xref>A). According to the patent, other solvents at least partially miscible with water can be used, including aliphatic amides, alkyl glycols, dioxane, etc., and other cyanide salts, such as sodium, lithium or calcium cyanide, are also compatible with the method [<xref rid="B32-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Sorbinil is an aldose reductase inhibitor that has been evaluated in clinical trials to treat complications of chronic diabetes such as diabetic neuropathy. An U.S. patent of 1984 describes a simple method for its synthesis, where the key step involves a Bucherer&#x02013;Bergs reaction from 6-fluoro-4-chromanone, potassium cyanide and an excess of ammonium carbonate in aqueous ethanol at 65 &#x000b0;C for 63 h. An additional step of racemic resolution allowed the isolation of the pharmacologically active (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>)-(+)-enantiomer [<xref rid="B33-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-15-01009-sch010" ref-type="fig">Scheme 10</xref>B).</p><p>Pomaglumetad methionil (also called LY2140023) is a methionine amide of pomaglumetad, a non-natural amino acid that exhibits a potent agonist activity on mGlu2/3 receptors, particularly abundant in limbic and forebrain areas. It was proposed for the treatment of schizophrenia but failed to show efficacy in phase III clinical trials, although it may be effective in certain patient populations [<xref rid="B34-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Waer, Moher, et al. proposed a highly scalable synthetic pathway for this drug (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-15-01009-sch011" ref-type="fig">Scheme 11</xref>) that starts from ethyl diazoacetate, which was transformed into ketone <bold>32</bold> by a three-step route. Compound <bold>32</bold> was reacted with ammonium carbonate and potassium cyanide under the classical Bucherer&#x02013;Bergs conditions, yielding a mixture of methyl and ethyl esters, due to transesterification reactions, that was saponified to afford the desired hydantoin <bold>33</bold>. During optimization, it was assessed that in the Bucherer&#x02013;Bergs reaction 1 equivalent of KCN was enough to achieve the optimal yield of the product and 3.5 equivalents of ammonia guaranteed the robustness of the procedure. Compound <bold>34</bold>, a key intermediate for the synthesis of LY2140023, was isolated after the enantiomeric resolution of <bold>33</bold>. Hydrolysis of the hydantoin framework followed by two additional steps provided the amino acid <bold>35</bold>, which was finally transformed into pomaglumetad methionil (LY2140023) [<xref rid="B35-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-pharmaceuticals-15-01009"><title>2.3. Mannich Reaction</title><p>The Mannich reaction starts from ammonia or a primary or secondary amine, generally as a hydrochloride salt, an aldehyde and a compound having at least one active hydrogen atom to provide aminomethyl derivatives of the latter compound [<xref rid="B36-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The Mannich reaction can take place either under basic or acidic conditions, although the latter are more common (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-15-01009-sch012" ref-type="fig">Scheme 12</xref>). Under acidic conditions, the amine first reacts with the non-enolizable carbonyl compound to give a hemiaminal that after dehydration leads to an iminium cation <bold>32</bold>. This species reacts with the enolizable carbonyl compound through an aldol-type reaction resulting in the formation of the final product.</p><p>While the first example of this transformation was reported in 1903 by Tollens and von Marle, it was not until 1912 that Carl Mannich recognised its generality as a method for the synthesis of alkylated &#x003b2;-ketoamines (known as Mannich bases) and started its systematic study. Nowadays, the Mannich reaction, as well as its asymmetric variations [<xref rid="B37-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], has an important role in organic synthesis, including the preparation of complex natural products [<xref rid="B38-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and bioactive molecules [<xref rid="B6-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Many drug molecules contain structural fragments derived from a Mannich reaction or from reaction sequences initiated by a Mannich reaction (e.g., Mannich/Grignard); some representative examples are shown in <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-15-01009-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>As a representative example, we show in <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-15-01009-sch013" ref-type="fig">Scheme 13</xref> the synthesis of the analgesic drug tramadol, which involves an initial Mannich reaction between cyclohexanone, formaldehyde and dimethylamine followed by treatment of the resulting Mannich base with 3-methyoxyphenlyllithium [<xref rid="B40-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A similar sequence, using a Grignard reagent instead of the phenyllithium derivative, has allowed for a continuous-flow synthesis of tramadol [<xref rid="B41-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>Double Mannich reactions have been successfully employed for the synthesis of six-membered nitrogen heterocyclic rings. Sir Robert Robinson&#x02019;s pioneering synthesis of tropinone [<xref rid="B42-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] involved a multicomponent domino process comprising inter- and intramolecular Mannich steps (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-15-01009-sch014" ref-type="fig">Scheme 14</xref>). This reaction is historically relevant in that it constituted the first example of a biomimetic synthesis (i.e., a synthetic route designed to imitate a biosynthetic pathway). Reduction of tropinone provides tropine, a key building block in the synthesis of bioactive tropane alkaloids. For instance, atropine, an antimuscarinic alkaloid present in the &#x0201c;Essential Drugs List&#x0201d; by the World Health Organization, is employed to treat bradycardia and poisoning by organophosphate pesticides acting as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. This compound can be prepared by Fischer esterification of tropine with tropic acid or with methyl formylphenylacetate, followed by NaBH<sub>4</sub> reduction of the formyl group [<xref rid="B43-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. A related three-step flow protocol for atropine synthesis has been developed [<xref rid="B44-pharmaceuticals-15-01009" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>Asymmetric Mannich reactions are also important in drug synthesis. Ezetimibe is an inhibitor of the NPC1L1 transporter, responsible for the intestinal absorption of cholesterol and phytosterols, and it is an approved treatment of hypercholesterolemia for the prevention of cardiovascular events.

These drugs are agonists of GABA receptors, inducing sedative and anxiolytic effects that have been exploited in medical practice to treat insomnia and anxiety, although their large potential of abuse and use as a recreational drug caused their gradual withdrawal from the market. Thus, the multicomponent reaction of isatoic anhydride, triethyl orthoacetate, and a suitable aniline derivative afforded methaqualone and mecloqualone in good yields. When the multicomponent reaction was performed using ammonium acetate instead of aniline as the amine partner, compound <bold>128</bold> was isolated in good yield and its subsequent treatment with glycidol in the presence of Zn(ClO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&#x000b7;6H<sub>2</sub>O allowed the preparation of diproqualone (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-15-01009-sch063" ref-type="fig">Scheme 63</xref>).</p><p>Oseltamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor employed for the prevention and treatment of influenza A and B virus infection.

Summary and Outlook</title><p>Multicomponent reactions are widely regarded as one of the most promising approaches to improved sustainability in chemistry. Their advantages over multistep protocols include a higher synthetic efficiency and a reduction in waste generation due to their high atom- and step-economy, which allows for a lower consumption of solvents in extraction and purification stages. The application of MCRs to the preparation of active pharmaceutical ingredients has made good progress in recent years, and we believe that this technology is poised to become one of the mainstays of synthetic chemistry projects in the pharmaceutical industry. Among the pending issues to be resolved in multicomponent synthesis, enantioselectivity is particularly important in view of the relevance of chirality in drug action and therefore in the pharmaceutical industry.</p><p>By critically summarizing prior work in this topic, we hope that this review will serve to stimulate further work in this important area of chemistry.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, J.C.M.; writing&#x02014;original draft preparation, &#x000c1;.C., J.C., E.O.-R., J.C.M.; writing&#x02014;review and editing, &#x000c1;.C., J.C.M.; supervision, J.C.M.
