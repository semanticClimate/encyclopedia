By integrating molecular and electronic dynamics simulations, we have developed a greener analytical methodology that significantly reduces time and solvent waste. Our approach focuses on selecting a compromise solvent to minimize peak broadening, thereby enhancing spectral resolution and simplifying the analytical process. This work extends our ongoing efforts to establish the GbD concept in analytical chemistry, building on our previous research to promote sustainable and efficient analytical practices. The developed methods are based on simple mathematical manipulations, including Fourier self-deconvolution, absorption correction, and isoabsorptive point methods, along with ratio spectra approaches such as ratio difference and ratio derivative spectrophotometric methods. The Hydrochlorothiazide and Triamterene were determined with linear ranges of (1-18) \u00b5g/mL and (1-14) \u00b5g/mL, respectively. The detection and quantitation limits were in the range of (0.255-0.640) \u00b5g/mL, and (0.516-1.359) \u00b5g/mL, which reflects the method's sensitivity. Moreover, a greenness assessment was performed to evaluate the sustainability of the proposed methods, indicating greener outcomes with a considerable reduction of the ecological footprint. This comprehensive approach underscores the potential of GbD in developing efficient, greener analytical methodologies for pharmaceutical analysis.", "affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Chemistry Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Egyptian Russian University, Badr City, 11829, Cairo, Egypt.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": {"agency": "Egyptian Russian University", "orderIn": "0"}}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Hydrochlorothiazide", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "AN", "qualifierName": "analysis", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "CH", "qualifierName": "chemistry", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Triamterene", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "AN", "qualifierName": "analysis", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "CH", "qualifierName": "chemistry", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "MT", "qualifierName": "methods", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Green Chemistry Technology", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "MT", "qualifierName": "methods", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Molecular Dynamics Simulation"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Greenness-by-design", "Mathematically Manipulated Spectral Methods", "Molecular And Electronic Dynamics Simulations", "Ratio-based Uv Spectrophotometry"]}, "chemicalList": {"chemical": [{"name": "Hydrochlorothiazide", "registryNumber": "0J48LPH2TH"}, {"name": "Triamterene", "registryNumber": "WS821Z52LQ"}]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-13486-2"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12325619"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12325619?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2025-08-06", "dateOfCreation": "2025-08-06", "firstIndexDate": "2025-08-07", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2025-08-08", "dateOfRevision": "2025-08-09", "electronicPublicationDate": "2025-08-06", "firstPublicationDate": "2025-08-06"}
