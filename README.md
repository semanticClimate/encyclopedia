# Encyclopedia Project

A comprehensive toolset for extracting and analyzing keywords from scientific documents, with a focus on climate change research and IPCC reports.

## Project Overview

This project consists of two main subprojects that work together to process scientific documents and extract meaningful insights:

1. **Keyword_extraction** - AI-powered keyword extraction from text documents
2. **Dictionary** - Structured storage and analysis of extracted keywords and document content

## Subprojects

### Keyword_extraction
A Python-based tool that uses state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to extract the most important keywords and keyphrases from scientific text documents. Built with Hugging Face transformers and optimized for academic content.

**Key Features:**
- AI-powered keyword extraction using pre-trained models
- Support for multiple text processing methods (sentence-based, chunk-based)
- Batch processing for large documents
- CSV output format for easy analysis
- Configurable top-N keyword extraction

**Use Cases:**
- Academic paper analysis
- Research document summarization
- Content indexing and search
- Literature review automation

### Dictionary
A structured storage system for organizing extracted keywords, document content, and metadata. Currently contains processed IPCC Working Group 1 reports with extracted keywords and full text content.

**Key Features:**
- Organized storage of document chapters
- Keyword frequency analysis
- HTML and plain text document versions
- CSV exports for data analysis
- Structured directory organization

**Current Content:**
- IPCC WG1 Chapter 1: Introduction
- IPCC WG1 Chapter 5: Global Carbon and Other Biogeochemical Cycles
- IPCC WG1 Chapter 6: Short-lived Climate Forcers

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd encyclopedia

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies for keyword extraction
cd Keyword_extraction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

#### Extract Keywords from a Document
```bash
cd Keyword_extraction
python Keyword_extraction.py -i your_document.txt -s results/ -o keywords.csv -n 500
```

**Parameters:**
- `-i`: Input text file path
- `-s`: Output directory for results
- `-o`: Output CSV filename
- `-n`: Number of top keywords to extract

#### View Extracted Keywords
```bash
# Navigate to Dictionary directory to view processed content
cd Dictionary/ipcc_wg1/ipcc_wg1_ch1
# View top keywords
cat top_keywords_only.txt
# Or open CSV file in Excel/Google Sheets
open top_keywords.csv
```

## Contributing

This project follows established style guidelines:

- Use absolute imports with module prefixes
- Keep `__init__.py` files empty unless explicitly agreed
- Follow established naming conventions (alphanumeric + underscores only)
- Always propose changes before implementation
- Work in small, testable steps

## License

See [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

## Support

For questions or issues:
1. Check the subproject-specific README files
2. Review the workflow documentation in `Keyword_extraction/workflow.md`
3. Examine existing examples in the `Dictionary` directory

## Development Notes

- All output files are stored in designated directories to maintain project structure
- The project follows climate change research examples for demonstrations
- Keywords are extracted using the `ml6team/keyphrase-extraction-kbir-inspec` model
- Document processing supports both HTML and plain text formats
