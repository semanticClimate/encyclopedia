Who owns our knowledge? What can we do about it?
15:48:11 In previous, uh, session, I showed that we do not own our knowledge, or at least a large part of it.
15:48:19 So, what are we going to do about it?
15:48:22 I think there are…
15:48:24 The following things, uh, that are possible.
15:48:27 One is political. We can get the situation changed,
15:48:31 Whereby, by law, and by governmental action,
15:48:36 In terms of funding and so on.
15:48:38 Uh, we can transfer…
15:48:41 The ownership of our knowledge back to ourselves.
15:48:45 This is going to be difficult.
15:48:47 Uh, because we're facing a mega million
15:48:50 or make a billion industry.
15:48:52 Uh, we exceeds the value of
15:48:54 Taking our knowledge from us,
15:48:57 Preventing us using it, and using it for its own purposes.
15:49:00 So, to overturn a very large
15:49:04 industry is difficult.
15:49:05 Uh, given that the industry has many lobbyists. If you go to else…
15:49:11 If you go to Brussels, there are permanent Elsevier
15:49:15 lobbyists in Brussels.
15:49:17 Um, and…
15:49:19 Uh, so it's going to take a lot of work.
15:49:22 Uh, to convince legislators and, um,
15:49:27 Policymakers to change that.
15:49:29 Nevertheless, I think we should aim for that.
15:49:33 Um, and I think everybody involved in the creation and dissemination
15:49:38 of scholarly knowledge, uh, should…
15:49:41 uh, have this as part of their agenda,
15:49:44 To cry and change our…
15:49:47 process, uh, back to where we own our knowledge, and we can say,
15:49:51 What is done with the knowledge.
15:49:55 However, that's not going to happen in my lifetime.
15:49:59 Um, I've, uh, seen 30 years of effort.
15:50:05 Uh, trying to create open access,
15:50:08 Um, for everybody, uh,
15:50:11 And with a very, um, poor amount of
15:50:15 access at the moment for many people in the world.
15:50:21 Um, so…
15:50:24 The other way to change things is to create something which is simply better.
15:50:30 than what we have at the moment.
15:50:32 Now, this again is going to be extremely difficult.
15:50:35 Uh, but it's one of the main things that causes
15:50:39 Um, uh, technical revolutions to take place.
15:50:42 Um, so, um, in the same way as the railways displace the canals,
15:50:48 Uh, because they were better for almost everything.
15:50:53 We need to create a new way of managing knowledge
15:50:56 Uh, which is better than the, um,
15:51:00 Uh, current industry of publishers
15:51:03 Uh, and legislation of
15:51:06 Um, control.
15:51:10 How are we going to do that?
15:51:11 Well, it was going to be extremely difficult.
15:51:15 However, we're now in an era where
15:51:19 The tools that we've got are…
15:51:21 vastly more powerful, um, than…
15:51:24 Uh, the ones that existed 10 years ago.
15:51:27 Um, we have…
15:51:31 distributed networks.
15:51:32 a very large number of the world is on networks.
15:51:36 Um, and the group that I'm involved with
15:51:39 Uh, in India and Germany and UK meets every day for
15:51:45 Uh, 2 hours online.
15:51:48 And creates high-quality,
15:51:50 material, um…
15:51:52 and saves it in a way which would have been
15:51:55 impossible to think of.
15:51:57 Uh, probably 15 years ago, or even 10 years ago.
15:52:01 So, the tools are much better.
15:52:05 Uh, then the realization that knowledge is
15:52:09 Um, eh, is…
15:52:13 a richer format than it was before, and here I use the word semantic.
15:52:19 If we can create semantic knowledge,
15:52:22 for the world, then it will be vastly superior to
15:52:27 the current textual information.
15:52:30 Uh, that we have, uh, which is, in many cases, extremely limiting.
15:52:36 So, I'll probably do another blog on why PDFs are so awful.
15:52:42 And they're not just awful, um…
15:52:45 Objectively, uh, they are seriously neocolonialist in terms of
15:52:50 how they present knowledge to the
15:52:53 world in general.
15:52:54 But if we move towards semantic knowledge,
15:52:58 Uh, then we can make knowledge available for everybody.
15:53:03 Um, so the first thing that semantic knowledge does
15:53:08 Is it structures it,
15:53:10 in a way, uh, which
15:53:12 isn't possible by using the current
15:53:15 Um, PDF print.
15:53:17 Uh, technology.
15:53:20 Um,
15:53:22 There are semantic systems, and by far the most
15:53:26 Uh, widely known is Wikipedia.
15:53:29 Pedia, Wikidata,
15:53:31 Wixner and other media wiki
15:53:34 Um, uh…
15:53:38 And Wikimedia Tools.
15:53:41 Uh, so, this…
15:53:43 From the beginning, created Semantic.
15:53:47 information. It wasn't always very
15:53:50 easy to create, because there were no tools.
15:53:53 Um, and, um…
15:53:55 it still doesn't cover…
15:53:57 a number of, uh, areas of semantics.
15:54:00 But it's vastly better than what the publishing industry does.
15:54:05 Uh, so, the goal, I believe, um, is to create
15:54:12 Uh, semantic knowledge,
15:54:14 and publish it as such.
15:54:16 But to make sure that everyone who publishes semantic knowledge
15:54:20 Uh, retains
15:54:23 The control of that knowledge, and does not hand it over.
15:54:27 to a publisher.
15:54:28 So, let us, um…
15:54:32 create, uh, knowledge now.
15:54:35 Uh, which is semantic and available to…
15:54:38 all the world, where the world can control it, and not some commercial organization.
15:54:46 As I said, that won't be easy to do.
15:54:49 Um, and, um…
15:54:51 It won't, uh, be accepted by, uh, rational or moral arguments. It will be accepted because it's better.
15:55:01 Um, and so the goal of this particular
15:55:06 Um, set of…
15:55:09 Um, workshops,
15:55:11 Uh, with NYIT and Semantic Climate is to show what semantics is,
15:55:17 And, um…
15:55:19 To show how it's better.
15:55:24 So, we were urged anyone
15:55:27 Uh, who is listening in to this, or who reads it afterwards,
15:55:31 Uh, to think about making their material semantic.
15:55:36 Um, and…
15:55:38 Uh, uh, make it… making it available to the whole world.
