In today's world, information is virtually limitless. There are a vast number of research papers, reports, and review articles that are scattered across multiple journals, database and repository. However, much of this information is present in an unstructured format making it difficult to extract meaningful knowledge from it. Furthermore, studying the relationship between  scientific entities across different publications remains a complex and time-consuming process.
To overcome this limitation, our encyclopedia system offers an open, reproducible, and automated framework that extracts, organizes, and semantify the information. It transforms the unstructured literature into structured human-readable, and machine-interpretable knowledge base. It helps users to understand the interconnections between entities, topics, and articles.
The user also gets insights into how the concepts relate across various papers, articles providing them with a holistic view rather than an isolated reading. The system ensures that verified and high-quality scientific knowledge is made freely accessible to all students, researchers, educators, and the wider public — thereby democratizing knowledge creation and consumption.The encyclopedia bridges the gap between information and knowledge through structured representation and semantic information, empowering users to explore and understand scientific information in a transparent, and reproducible manner.
